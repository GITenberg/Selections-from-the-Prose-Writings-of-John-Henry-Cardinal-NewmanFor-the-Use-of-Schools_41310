<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>It has come to be universally admitted that Cardinal Newman fulfills his
own definition of a great author: "One whose aim is to give forth what
he has within him; and from his very earnestness it happens that
whatever be the splendor of his diction, or the harmony of his periods,
he has with him the charm of an incommunicable simplicity.</p>

<p>"Whatever be his subject, high or low, he treats it suitably and for its
own sake.... He writes passionately because he feels keenly; forcibly,
because he conceives vividly; he sees too clearly to be vague; he is too
serious to be otiose; he can analyze his subject, and therefore he is
rich; he embraces it as a whole and in its parts, and therefore he is
consistent; he has a firm hold of it, and therefore he is luminous.</p>

<p>"When his imagination wells up, it overflows in ornament; when his heart
is touched, it thrills along his verse. He always has the right word for
the right idea, and never a word too much.... </p>

<p>"He expresses what all feel but cannot say; and his sayings pass into
proverbs among his people, and his phrases become household words,
idioms of their daily speech, which is tessellated with the rich
fragments of his language, as we see in foreign lands the marbles of
Roman grandeur worked into the walls and pavements of modern palaces."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>Newman may be said to have handled England's prose as Shakespeare
handled her verse. His language was wrought up little by little to a
finish and refinement, a strength and a subtlety, thrown into the form
of eloquence, beyond which no English writer of prose has gone. Nor is
his excellence that of mere art in form; he possesses not only skill,
which he calls an exercise of talent, but power&mdash;a second name for
genius&mdash;which itself implies personality and points to inspiration.</p>

<p>His mind was large, logical, profoundly thoughtful, imaginative,
intense, sincere, and above all, spiritual; his soul was keen, delicate,
sympathetic, heroic; and his life, at once severe and tender, passionate
and self-controlled, alone and unlonely, stands out in its loftiness and
saintliness, a strange, majestic contrast to the agitation and turmoil
of "confused passions, hesitating ideals, tentative virtues, and groping
philanthropies" amidst which it was lived.</p>

<p>Both by word and work did Newman lead forth his generation on the long
pilgrimage to the shrine of Truth, and England of the nineteenth century
has no surer claim to holiness and genius for her great sons than that
set upon John Henry Newman.</p>

<p>He was born in London, 1801; studied, taught, and preached at Oxford;
became the chief promoter of the Tractarian Movement of 1833; entered
the Catholic Church in 1845; founded the Oratory at Birmingham, 1848;
was created Cardinal by Pope Leo XIII. 1879; died at Edgbaston, 1890.</p>

<p>Any attempt to choose from the writings of Newman what seems most
desirable for brief class studies is certain to be woefully embarrassed
by the very wealth of matter; and apology for risking the choice would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>be due, were it not lost sight of in the desire to see a literary
model so pure, varied, animated, forceful, luminous&mdash;"a thing of
light and beauty"&mdash;given to our students.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>What is more significant of the Life Book of the saintly Oxford
Scholar than his self-written epitaph: "Ex umbris et imaginibus in
veritatem"?</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<h2><a name="APPRECIATIONS" id="APPRECIATIONS"></a>APPRECIATIONS</h2>


<p>Newman's best essays display a delicate and flexible treatment of
language, without emphasis, without oddity, which hardly arrests the
attention at first,&mdash;the reader being absorbed in the argument or
statement,&mdash;but which, in course of time, fascinates, as a thing
miraculous in its limpid grace and suavity.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash;<i>Edmund Gosse's History of Modern English Literature.</i></span><br /></p>

<p>The work of Newman reveals him as one of the great masters of graceful,
scholarly, finished prose. It is individual, it has charm, and this is
the secret of its power to interest. No writer of our time has reflected
his mind and heart in his pages as has Newman. He has light for the
intellect and warmth for the heart.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash;<i>A. J. George's Types of Literary Art.</i></span><br /></p>

<p>Newman towers, with only three or four compeers, above his generation;
and now that the benignity of his great nature has passed from our
sight, its majesty is more evident year by year.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash;<i>Scudder's Modern English Poets.</i></span></p>

<p>The finish and urbanity of Newman's prose have been universally
commended even by those who are most strenuously opposed to his
opinions.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash;<i>H. J. Nicoll.</i></span><br /></p>

<p>All the resources of a master of English style are at Newman's command:
pure diction, clear arrangement, delicate irony, gracious dignity, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>copious command of words combined with a chaste reserve in using
them.<br /> All these qualities go to make up the charm of Newman's
style&mdash;the finest flower that the earliest system of a purely
classical education has produced.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash;<i>J. Jacobs's Literary Studies.</i></span><br /></p>

<p>Newman combines a thoroughly classical training, a scholarly form, with
the incommunicable and almost inexplicable power to move audiences and
readers.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash;<i>George Saintsbury.</i></span><br /></p>

<p>The pure style of Newman may be compared in its distinguishing quality
to the atmosphere. It is at once simple and subtle, vigorous and
elastic; it penetrates into every recess of its subject; it is
transparent, allowing each object it touches to display its own proper
color.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash;<i>H. E. Beeching's English Prose.</i></span><br /></p>

<p>There are touching passages characteristic of Newman's writings which
give them a peculiar charm. They are those which yield momentary
glimpses of a very tender heart that has a burden of its own, unrevealed
to man.... It is, as I have heard it described, as though he suddenly
opened a book and gave you a glimpse for a moment of wonderful secrets,
and then as quickly closed it.... In Newman's Sermons, how the old truth
became new; how it came home, as he spoke, with a meaning never felt
before! He laid his finger how gently, yet how powerfully, on some inner
place in the hearer's heart, and told him things about himself he had
never known till then. Subtlest truths, which it would have taken
philosophers pages of circumlocution and big words to state, were
dropped out by the way in a sentence or two of the most transparent
Saxon. What delicacy of style, yet what strength! how simple, yet how
suggestive! how penetrating, yet how refined! how homely, yet how <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> tender-hearted! You might come away
still not believing the tenets peculiar to the High Church System, but
you would be harder than most men if you did not feel more than ever
ashamed of coarseness, selfishness, worldliness, if you did not feel the
things of faith brought closer to the soul.... Newman's innate and
intense idealism is, perhaps, his most striking characteristic.... It is
a thought of his, always deeply felt and many times repeated, that this
visible world is but the outward shell of an invisible kingdom, a screen
which hides from our view things far greater and more wonderful than any
which we see, and that the unseen world is close to us and ever ready to
break through the shell and manifest itself.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash;<i>Shairp.</i></span><br /></p>

<p>Newman's great reputation for prose and the supreme interest attaching
to his life seem to have obscured the fame he might have won as a poet.
He was in poetry, as in theology, a more masculine Keble, but with all
the real purity of Keble, with also the indispensable flavor of
earth.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash;<i>H. Walker.</i></span><br /></p>

<p>The <i>Dream of Gerontius</i> resembles Dante more than any other poetry
written since the great Tuscan's time.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash;<i>Sir Henry Taylor.</i></span><br /></p>

<p>The <i>Dream</i> is a rare poetic rendering into English verse of that high
ritual which from the death-bed to the Mass of Supplication encompasses
the faithful soul.... Newman has no marked affinities with English
writers of his day. He is strikingly different from Macaulay, whose
eloquence betrays the fury, as it is annealed in the fire, of the
Western Celt. To Ruskin, who deliberately built up a monument, stately
as the palace of Kubla Khan, he is a contrast, for the very reason that
he does not handle words as if they were settings in architecture or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>colors in a palette; rather, he would look upon them as
transparencies which let his meaning through. He is more like De
Quincey, but again no player upon the organ for the sake of its music;
and that which is common to both is the literary tradition of the
eighteenth century enhanced by a power to which abstract and concrete
yielded in almost equal degree.... With so prompt and intense an
intellect at his call, there was no subject, outside purely technical
criticism, which Newman could not have mastered.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash;<i>Barry's Literary Lives.</i></span><br /></p>

<p>It is when Newman exerts his flexible and vivid imagination in depicting
the deepest religious passion that we are most carried away by him and
feel his great genius most truly.... Whether tried by the test of
nobility, intensity, and steadfastness of his work, or by the test of
the greatness of the powers which have been consecrated to that work,
Cardinal Newman has been one of the greatest of our modern great men.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash;<i>R. H. Hutton's Life of Newman.</i></span><br /></p>

<p>Newman's mind was world-wide. He was interested in everything that was
going on in science, in the highest form of politics, in literature....
Nothing was too large for him, nothing too trivial, if it threw light
upon the central question,&mdash;what man really is and what is his
destiny.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash;<i>J. A. Froude.</i></span><br /></p>

<p>In Newman's sketch of the influence of Abelard on his disciples is seen
his belief in the immense power for good or ill of a dominating
personality. And he himself supplied an object-lesson in his theory.
Shairp, Froude, Church, Wilberforce, Gladstone, are only a few of those
who have borne testimony to the personal magnetism which left its mark
on the whole of thinking Oxford. "Cor ad cor loquitur," the motto chosen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>by Newman on his receiving the Cardinal's hat, expressed to him
the whole reality of intercourse between man and man, and man and
God.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash;<i>Wilfrid Ward's Problems and Persons.</i></span><br /></p>

<p>Newman's mind swung through a wide arc, and thoughts apparently
antagonistic often were to him supplemental each to each.... A man of
dauntless courage and profound thoughtfulness, while his intellect was
pre&euml;minently a logical one, both the heart and the moral sense
possessed with him their sacred tribunals in matters of reasoning as
well as of sentiment.... The extreme subtlety of his intelligence
opposed no hindrance to his power of exciting vehement emotion.<br />

<p>"I gave them a king in mine anger, and took him away in my <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> wrath."&mdash;<i>Hosea</i> xiii. 11.<br /></p>

<blockquote><p>The Israelites seem to have asked for a king<br />
from an unthankful caprice and waywardness.<br />
The ill conduct, indeed, of Samuel's sons was the<br />
occasion of the sin, but "an evil heart of<br />
unbelief," to use Scripture language, was the real cause<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_13_5" id="PgLn_13_5"></a>{5}</span><br />
of it. They had ever been restless and<br />
dissatisfied, asking for flesh when they had manna,<br />
fretful for water, impatient of the wilderness, bent<br />
on returning to Egypt, fearing their enemies,<br />
murmuring against Moses. They had miracles<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_13_10" id="PgLn_13_10"></a><a href="#Manna">{10}</a></span><br />
even to satiety; and then, for a change, they<br />
wished a king like the nations. This was the<br />
chief reason of their sinful demand. And further,<br />
they were dazzled with the pomp and splendor<br />
of the heathen monarchs around them, and they<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_13_15" id="PgLn_13_15"></a><a href="#Moses">{15}</a></span><br />
desired some one to fight their battles, some<br />
visible succor to depend on, instead of having<br />
to wait for an invisible Providence, which came in<br />
its own way and time, by little and little, being<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
dispensed silently, or tardily, or (as they might<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_13_20" id="PgLn_13_20">{20}</a></span><br />
consider) unsuitably. Their carnal hearts did<br />
not love the neighborhood of heaven; and, like<br />
the inhabitants of Gadara afterwards, they prayed<br />
that Almighty God would depart from their<br />
coasts.</p></blockquote><p><span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_14_5" id="PgLn_14_5"></a><a href="#Gadara">{5}</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>Such were some of the feelings under which they<br />
desired a king like the nations; and God at length<br />
granted their request. To punish them, He gave<br />
them a king <i>after their own heart</i>, Saul, the son of<br />
Kish, a Benjamite; of whom the text speaks in<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_14_10" id="PgLn_14_10">{10}</a></span><br />
these terms, "I gave them a king in Mine anger,<br />
and took him away in My wrath."<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>There is, in true religion, a sameness, an absence<br />
of hue and brilliancy, in the eyes of the natural<br />
man; a plainness, austereness, and (what he <span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_14_15" id="PgLn_14_15">{15}</a></span><br />
considers) sadness. It is like the heavenly manna of<br />
which the Israelites complained, insipid, and at<br />
length wearisome, "like wafers made with honey."<br />
They complained that "their soul was dried<br />
away." "There is nothing at all," they said,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_14_20" id="PgLn_14_20">{20}</a></span><br />
"beside this manna, before our eyes.... We<br />
remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt<br />
freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the<br />
leeks, and the onions, and the garlick."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>Such<br />
were the dainty meats in which their soul<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_14_25" id="PgLn_14_25">{25}</a></span><br />
delighted; and for the same reason they desired a<br />
king. Samuel had too much of primitive<br />
simplicity about him to please them, they felt they<br />
were behind the world, and clamored to be put<br />
on a level with the heathen.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_14_30" id="PgLn_14_30">{30}</a></span></p></blockquote>

as of mind&mdash;a circumstance which seems to<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_15_5" id="PgLn_15_5">{5}</a></span><br />
have attracted their admiration. He is described<br />
in person as if one of those sons of Anak, before<br />

than any of the people."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Both his virtues and<br />
his faults were such as became an eastern monarch,<br />
and were adapted to secure the fear and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_15_15" id="PgLn_15_15">{15}</a></span><br />
submission of his subjects. Pride, haughtiness,<br />
obstinacy, reserve, jealousy, caprice&mdash;these, in<br />
their way, were not unbecoming qualities in the<br />
king after whom their imaginations roved. On<br />
the other hand, the better parts of his character<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_15_20" id="PgLn_15_20">{20}</a></span><br />
were of an excellence sufficient to engage the<br />
affection of Samuel himself.</p></blockquote>

faithfully till he was "old and gray-headed,"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and<br />
who resolved on setting over themselves a king<br />
against his earnest entreaties, still we find no trace<br />
of coldness or jealousy in his behavior towards<br />
Saul. On his first meeting with him, he addressed<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_15_30" id="PgLn_15_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>him in the words of loyalty&mdash;"On whom<br />
is all the desire of Israel? is it not on thee, and<br />
on all thy father's house?" Afterwards, when he<br />
anointed him king, he "kissed him, and said, Is it<br />
not because the Lord hath anointed thee to be<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_16_5" id="PgLn_16_5">{5}</a></span><br />
captain over His inheritance?" When he announced<br />
him to the people as their king, he said,<br />
"See ye him whom the Lord hath chosen, that<br />
there is none like him among all the people?"<br />
And, some time after, when Saul had irrecoverably<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_16_10" id="PgLn_16_10">{10}</a></span><br />
lost God's favor, we are told, "Samuel came no<br />
more to see Saul until the day of his death:<br />
<i>nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul</i>." In the<br />
next chapter he is even rebuked for immoderate<br />
grief&mdash;"How long wilt thou mourn for Saul,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_16_15" id="PgLn_16_15">{15}</a></span><br />
seeing I have rejected him from reigning over<br />
Israel?"<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Such sorrow speaks favorably for<br />
Saul as well as for Samuel; it is not only the grief<br />
of a loyal subject and a zealous prophet, but,<br />
moreover, of an attached friend; and, indeed,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_16_20" id="PgLn_16_20">{20}</a></span><br />
instances are recorded, in the first years of his<br />
reign, of forbearance, generosity, and neglect of<br />
self, which sufficiently account for the feelings<br />
with which Samuel regarded him. David, under<br />
very different circumstances, seems to have felt<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_16_25" id="PgLn_16_25"></a><a href="#David">{25}</a></span><br />
for him a similar affection.<br /></p></blockquote>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>him. He kept it secret, leaving it to Samuel, who<br />
had made it to him, to publish it. "Saul said<br />
unto his uncle, He" (that is, Samuel) "told us<br />

matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_17_5" id="PgLn_17_5">{5}</a></span><br />

was averse to the dignity intended for him; for<br />
when the Divine lot fell upon him, he hid himself,<br />
and was not discovered by the people, without<br />
recourse to Divine assistance. The appointment<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_17_10" id="PgLn_17_10"></a><a href="#The_Ammonites">{10}</a></span><br />
was at first unpopular. "The children of Belial<br />
said, How shall this man save us? They despised<br />
him, and brought him no presents, <i>but he held his<br />

country beyond Jordan, with the avowed intention of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_17_15" id="PgLn_17_15"></a><a href="#The_Jordan">{15}</a></span><br />
subjugating it. The people sent to Saul for relief<br />
almost in despair; and the panic spread in the<br />
interior as well as among those whose country<br />
was immediately threatened. The history<br />
proceeds: "<i>Behold, Saul came after the herd out of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_17_20" id="PgLn_17_20">{20}</a></span><br />
the field</i>; and Saul said, What aileth the people<br />
that they weep? and they told him the tidings<br />
of the men of Jabesh. And the Spirit of God<br />
came upon Saul, and his anger was kindled<br />
greatly." His order for an immediate gathering<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_17_25" id="PgLn_17_25">{25}</a></span><br />
throughout Israel was obeyed with the alacrity<br />
with which the multitude serve the strong-minded<br />
in times of danger. A decisive victory over the<br />
enemy followed; then the popular cry became,<br />
"Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us?<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_17_30" id="PgLn_17_30">{30}</a></span><br />

a prosperous king. He had been appointed to<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_18_5" id="PgLn_18_5">{5}</a></span><br />
subdue the enemies of Israel, and success attended<br />
his arms. At the end of the fourteenth chapter,<br />

spoiled them."<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Such was Saul's character and success; his<br />
character faulty, yet not without promise; his<br />
success in arms as great as his carnal subjects<br />
could have desired. Yet, in spite of Samuel's<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_18_20" id="PgLn_18_20">{20}</a></span><br />
private liking for him, and in spite of the good<br />
fortune which actually attended him, we find that<br />
from the beginning the prophet's voice is raised<br />
both against people and king in warnings and<br />
rebukes, which are omens of his destined<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_18_25" id="PgLn_18_25">{25}</a></span><br />
destruction, according to the text, "I gave them a king in<br />
Mine anger, and took him away in My wrath."<br />
At the very time that Saul is publicly received as<br />
king, Samuel protests, "Ye have this day rejected<br />
your God, who Himself saved you out of all your <span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_18_30" id="PgLn_18_30">{30}</a></span><br />

subsequent assembly of the people, in which he<br />
testified his uprightness, he says, "Is it not wheat<br />

He shall send thunder and rain; <i>that ye may<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_19_5" id="PgLn_19_5">{5}</a></span><br />

and at first sight no very heinous sin, the sentence<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_19_10" id="PgLn_19_10">{10}</a></span><br />
of rejection is passed upon him: "Thy kingdom<br />

<blockquote><p>Here, then, a question may be raised&mdash;-Why<br />
was Saul thus marked for vengeance from the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_19_15" id="PgLn_19_15">{15}</a></span><br />
beginning? Why these presages of misfortune,<br />
which from the first hung over him, gathered, fell<br />
in storm and tempest, and at length overwhelmed<br />
him? Is his character so essentially faulty that<br />
it must be thus distinguished for reprobation<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_19_20" id="PgLn_19_20">{20}</a></span><br />
above all the anointed kings after him? Why,<br />
while David is called a man after God's own heart,<br />
should Saul be put aside as worthless?<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>This question leads us to a deeper inspection of,<br />
his character. Now, we know, the first duty of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_19_25" id="PgLn_19_25"></a><a href="#Gods_vicegerent">{25}</a></span><br />
every man is the fear of God&mdash;a reverence for His<br />
word, a love of Him, and a desire to obey Him; and,<br />
besides, it was peculiarly incumbent on the king of<br />
Israel, as God's vicegerent, by virtue of his office, to<br />
promote His glory whom his subjects had rejected.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_19_30" id="PgLn_19_30">{30}</a></span><br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Now Saul "lacked this one thing." His<br /> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
character, indeed, is obscure, and we must be cautious<br />
while considering it; still, as Scripture is given us<br />
for our instruction, it is surely right to make the<br />
most of what we find there, and to form our<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_20_5" id="PgLn_20_5">{5}</a></span><br />
judgment by such lights as we possess. It would<br />
appear, then, that Saul was never under the<br />
abiding influence of religion, or, in Scripture language,<br />
"the fear of God," however he might be at times<br />
moved and softened. Some men are inconsistent<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_20_10" id="PgLn_20_10"></a><a href="#Solomon">{10}</a></span><br />
in their conduct, as Samson; or as Eli, in a<br />
different way; and yet may have lived by faith,<br />
though a weak faith. Others have sudden falls,<br />
as David had. Others are corrupted by<br />
prosperity, as Solomon. But as to Saul, there is no<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_20_15" id="PgLn_20_15"></a><a href="#Religious_principle">{15}</a></span><br />
proof that he had any deep-seated religious<br />
principle at all; rather, it is to be feared, that his<br />
history is a lesson to us, that the "heart of unbelief"<br />
may exist in the very sight of God, may rule a man<br />
in spite of many natural advantages of character,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_20_20" id="PgLn_20_20">{20}</a></span><br />
in the midst of much that is virtuous, amiable,<br />
and commendable.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Saul, it would seem, was naturally brave,<br />
active, generous, and patient; and what nature<br />
made him, such he remained, that is, without<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_20_25" id="PgLn_20_25">{25}</a></span><br />
improvement; with virtues which had no value,<br />
because they required no effort, and implied the<br />
influence of no principle. On the other hand,<br />
when we look for evidence of his faith, that is, his<br />
practical sense of things unseen, we discover<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_20_30" id="PgLn_20_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>instead a deadness to all considerations not connected<br />
with the present world. It is his habit to<br />
treat prophet and priest with a coldness, to say<br />
the least, which seems to argue some great internal<br />
defect. It would not be inconsistent with the<br />
Scripture account of him, even should the real<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_21_5" id="PgLn_21_5">{5}</a></span><br />
fact be, that (with some general notions<br />
concerning the being and providence of God) he doubted<br />
of the divinity of the Dispensation of which he was<br />
an instrument. The circumstance which first<br />
introduces him to the inspired history is not in his<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_21_10" id="PgLn_21_10">{10}</a></span><br />
favor. While in search of his father's asses,<br />
which were lost, he came to the city where<br />
Samuel was; and though Samuel was now an old<br />
man, and from childhood known as the especial<br />
minister and prophet of the God of Israel, Saul<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_21_15" id="PgLn_21_15"></a><a href="#Shekel">{15}</a></span><br />
seems to have considered him as a mere diviner,<br />
such as might be found among the heathen, who,<br />
for "the fourth part of a shekel of silver," would<br />
tell him his way.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The narrative goes on to mention, that after his<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_21_20" id="PgLn_21_20">{20}</a></span><br />
leaving Samuel "God gave him another heart,"<br />
and on meeting a company of prophets, "the<br />
Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied<br />
among them." Upon this, "all that knew him<br />
beforetime" said, "What is this that is come unto<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_21_25" id="PgLn_21_25">{25}</a></span><br />
the son of Kish: is Saul also among the prophets?<br />
... therefore it became a proverb." From this<br />
narrative we gather, that his carelessness and<br />
coldness in religious matters were so notorious,<br />
that, in the eyes of his acquaintance, there was<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_21_30" id="PgLn_21_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>a certain strangeness and incongruity, which at<br />
once struck the mind, in his being associated with<br />
a school of the prophets.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Nor have we any reason to believe, from the<br />
after history, that the Divine gift, then first<br />
imparted, left any religious effect upon his mind.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_22_5" id="PgLn_22_5">{5}</a></span><br />
At a later period of his life we find him suddenly<br />
brought under the same sacred influence on his<br />
entering the school where Samuel taught; but,<br />
instead of softening him, its effect upon his<br />
outward conduct did but testify the fruitlessness of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_22_10" id="PgLn_22_10">{10}</a></span><br />
Divine grace when acting upon a will obstinately<br />
set upon evil.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The immediate occasion of his rejection was his<br />
failing under a specific trial of his obedience, as<br />
set before him at the very time he was anointed.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_22_15" id="PgLn_22_15">{15}</a></span><br />
He had collected with difficulty an army against<br />
the Philistines; while waiting for Samuel to offer<br />
the sacrifice, his people became dispirited, and<br />
began to fall off and return home. Here he was<br />
doubtless exposed to the temptation of taking<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_22_20" id="PgLn_22_20"></a><a href="#Sacrifice_offered_by_Saul">{20}</a></span><br />
unlawful measures to put a stop to their defection.<br />
But when we consider that the act to which he was<br />
persuaded was no less than that of his offering<br />
sacrifice&mdash;he being neither priest nor prophet,<br />
nor having any commission thus to interfere<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_22_25" id="PgLn_22_25">{25}</a></span><br />
with the Mosaic ritual&mdash;it is plain "his <i>forcing<br />
himself</i>" to do so (as he tenderly described his<br />
sin) was a direct profaneness&mdash;a profaneness<br />
which implied that he was careless about forms,<br />
which in this world will ever be essential to<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_22_30" id="PgLn_22_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>things supernatural, and thought it mattered<br />
little whether he acted in God's way or in his<br />
own.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>After this, he seems to have separated himself<br />
from Samuel, whom he found unwilling to become<br />
his instrument, and to have had recourse to the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_23_5" id="PgLn_23_5">{5}</a></span><br />
priesthood instead. Ahijah or Ahimelech (as he<br />
is afterwards called), the high priest, followed his<br />
camp; and the ark, too, in spite of the warning<br />
conveyed by the disasters which attended the<br />
presumptuous use of it in the time of Eli. "And<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_23_10" id="PgLn_23_10"></a><a href="#Ark_of_God">{10}</a></span><br />
Saul said unto Ahijah, Bring hither the ark of<br />
God;" while it was brought, a tumult which was<br />
heard in the camp of the Philistines increased.<br />
On this interruption Saul irreverently put the ark<br />
aside, and went out to the battle.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_23_15" id="PgLn_23_15">{15}</a></span><br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>It will be observed, that there was no professed<br />
or intentional irreverence in Saul's conduct; he<br />
was still on the whole the same he had ever been.<br />
He outwardly respected the Mosaic<br />
ritual&mdash;about this time he built his first altar to the Lord,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a><span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_23_20" id="PgLn_23_20">{20}</a></span><br />
and in a certain sense seemed to acknowledge God's<br />
authority. But nothing shows he considered that<br />
there was any vast distinction between Israel and<br />
the nations around them. He was <i>indifferent</i>, and<br />
cared for none of these things. The chosen people<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_23_25" id="PgLn_23_25">{25}</a></span><br />
desired a king like the nations, and such a one<br />
they received.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>After this he was commanded to "go and smite<br />
the sinners, the Amalekites, and utterly destroy<br />
them and their cattle." This was a judgment on<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_23_30" id="PgLn_23_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>them which God had long decreed, though He had<br />
delayed it; and He now made Saul the minister<br />
of His vengeance. But Saul performed it so far<br />
only as fell in with his own inclination and<br />
purposes. He smote, indeed, the Amalekites, and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_24_5" id="PgLn_24_5">{5}</a></span><br />
"destroyed all the people with the edge of the<br />
sword"&mdash;this exploit had its glory; the best of<br />
the flocks and herds he spared, and why? to<br />
sacrifice therewith to the Lord. But since God<br />
had expressly told him to destroy them, what<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_24_10" id="PgLn_24_10"></a><a href="#Religion_a_utility">{10}</a></span><br />
was this but to imply, that Divine intimations had<br />
nothing to do with such matters? what was it but<br />
to consider that the established religion was but<br />
a useful institution, or a splendid pageant<br />
suitable to the dignity of monarchy, but resting on no<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_24_15" id="PgLn_24_15">{15}</a></span><br />
unseen supernatural sanction? Certainly he in<br />
no sense acted in the fear of God, with the wish<br />
to please Him, and the conviction that he was in<br />
His sight. One might consider it mere pride and<br />
willfulness in him, acting in his own way because<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_24_20" id="PgLn_24_20">{20}</a></span><br />
it was his own (which doubtless it was in great<br />
measure), except that he appears to have had an<br />
eye to the feelings and opinions of men as to his<br />
conduct, though not to God's judgment. He<br />
"feared the people and obeyed their voice."<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_24_25" id="PgLn_24_25">{25}</a></span><br />
Again, he spared Agag, the king of the<br />
Amalekites. Doubtless he considered Agag as "his<br />
brother," as Ahab afterwards called Ben-hadad.<br />
Agag was a king, and Saul observed towards him<br />
that courtesy and clemency which earthly<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_24_30" id="PgLn_24_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>monarchs observe one towards another, and rightly<br />
when no Divine command comes in the way. But<br />
the God of Israel required a king after His own<br />

<blockquote><p>Such is the account given to Saul of David, in<br />
many respects the most favored of the ancient<br />
Saints. David is to be accounted the most<br />
favored, first as being the principal type of Christ,<br />
next as being the author of great part of the book<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_28_5" id="PgLn_28_5"></a><a href="#The_Psalms">{5}</a></span><br />
of Psalms, which have been used as the Church's<br />
form of devotion ever since his time. Besides, he<br />
was a chief instrument of God's providence, both<br />
in repressing idolatry and in preparing for the<br />
gospel; and he prophesied in an especial manner<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_28_10" id="PgLn_28_10">{10}</a></span><br />
of that Saviour whom he prefigured and preceded.<br />
Moreover, he was the chosen king of Israel, a man<br />
after God's own heart, and blessed, not only in<br />
himself, but in his seed after him. And, further,<br />
to the history of his life a greater share is given of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_28_15" id="PgLn_28_15">{15}</a></span><br />
the inspired pages than to that of any other of<br />
God's favored servants. Lastly, he displays in<br />
his personal character that very temper of mind<br />
in which his nation, or rather human nature<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>itself, is especially deficient. Pride and unbelief<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_28_20" id="PgLn_28_20">{20}</a></span><br />
disgrace the history of the chosen people; the<br />
deliberate love of this world, which was the sin of<br />
Balaam, and the presumptuous willfulness which<br />
is exhibited in Saul. But David is conspicuous<br />
for an affectionate, a thankful, a loyal heart<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_29_5" id="PgLn_29_5"></a><a href="#Balaam">{5}</a></span><br />
towards his God and defender, a zeal which was<br />
as fervent and as docile as Saul's was sullen,<br />
and as keen-sighted and as pure as Balaam's was<br />
selfish and double-minded. Such was the son<br />
of Jesse the Beth-lehemite; he stands midway<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_29_10" id="PgLn_29_10"></a><a href="#Judah">{10}</a></span><br />
between Abraham and his predicted seed, Judah<br />
and the Shiloh, receiving and transmitting the<br />
promises; a figure of the Christ, and an inspired<br />
prophet, living in the Church even to the end of<br />
time, in his office, his history, and his sacred<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_29_15" id="PgLn_29_15">{15}</a></span><br />
writings.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Some remarks on his early life, and on his<br />
character, as therein displayed, may profitably<br />
engage our attention at the present time.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>When Saul was finally rejected for not<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_29_20" id="PgLn_29_20">{20}</a></span><br />
destroying the Amalekites, Samuel was bid go to<br />
Bethlehem, and anoint, as future king of Israel, one<br />
of the sons of Jesse, who should be pointed out to<br />
him when he was come there. Samuel<br />
accordingly went thither and held a sacrifice; when, at<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_29_25" id="PgLn_29_25">{25}</a></span><br />
his command, Jesse's seven sons were brought by<br />
their father, one by one, before the prophet; but<br />
none of them proved to be the choice of Almighty<br />
God. David was the youngest and out of the<br />
way, and it seemed to Jesse as unlikely that God's<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_29_30" id="PgLn_29_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>choice should fall upon him, as it appeared to<br />
Joseph's brethren and to his father, that he and<br />
his mother and brethren should, as his dreams<br />
foretold, bow down before him. On Samuel's<br />
inquiring, Jesse said, "There remaineth yet the<br />
youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep."<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_30_5" id="PgLn_30_5">{5}</a></span><br />
On Samuel's bidding, he was sent for. "Now<br />
he was ruddy," the sacred historian proceeds,<br />
"and withal of a beautiful countenance, and<br />
goodly to look to. And the Lord said, Arise,<br />
anoint him, for this is he." After Samuel had<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_30_10" id="PgLn_30_10"></a><a href="#Anointing_of_David">{10}</a></span><br />
anointed him, "the Spirit of the Lord came upon<br />
David from that day forward." It is added,<br />
"But the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul."<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>David's anointing was followed by no other<br />
immediate mark of God's favor. He was tried<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_30_15" id="PgLn_30_15">{15}</a></span><br />
by being sent back again, in spite of the promise,<br />
to the care of his sheep, till an unexpected<br />
occasion introduced him to Saul's court. The<br />
withdrawing of the Spirit of the Lord from Saul was<br />
followed by frequent attacks from an evil spirit, as<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_30_20" id="PgLn_30_20">{20}</a></span><br />
a judgment upon him. His mind was depressed,<br />
and a "trouble," as it is called, came upon him,<br />
with symptoms very like those which we now<br />
refer to derangement. His servants thought that<br />
music, such, perhaps, as was used in the schools<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_30_25" id="PgLn_30_25">{25}</a></span><br />
of the prophets, might soothe and restore him;<br />
and David was recommended by one of them for<br />
that purpose, in the words of the text: "Behold,<br />
I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite,<br />
that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_30_30" id="PgLn_30_30">{30}</a></span><br />

and a comely person, and the Lord is with<br />
him."<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>David came in the power of that sacred<br />
influence whom Saul had grieved and rejected.<br />
The Spirit which inspired his tongue guided his<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_31_5" id="PgLn_31_5"></a><a href="#Sacred_songs">{5}</a></span><br />
hand also, and his sacred songs became a medicine<br />
to Saul's diseased mind. "When the evil spirit<br />
from God was upon Saul, ... David took an<br />
harp, and played with his hand; so Saul was<br />
refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_31_10" id="PgLn_31_10">{10}</a></span><br />
from him." Thus he is first introduced to us in<br />
that character in which he still has praise in the<br />
Church, as "the anointed of the God of Jacob,<br />
and the sweet psalmist of Israel."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a><br /></p></blockquote>

armor-bearer;" but the first trial of his humility<br />
and patience was not over, while many other trials<br />
were in store. After a while he was a second time<br />
sent back to his sheep; and though there was war<br />
with the Philistines, and his three eldest brethren<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_31_20" id="PgLn_31_20">{20}</a></span><br />
were in the army with Saul, and he had already<br />
essayed his strength in defending his father's<br />
flocks from wild beasts, and was "a mighty<br />
valiant man," yet he contentedly stayed at home<br />
as a private person, keeping his promise of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_31_25" id="PgLn_31_25">{25}</a></span><br />
greatness to himself, till his father bade him go to his<br />
brethren to take them a present from him, and<br />
report how they fared. An accident, as it<br />
appeared to the world, brought him forward. On<br />
his arrival at the army, he heard the challenge of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_31_30" id="PgLn_31_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>the Philistine champion, Goliath of Gath. I need<br />
not relate how he was divinely urged to engage<br />
the giant, how he killed him, and how he was, in<br />
consequence, again raised to Saul's favor; who,<br />
with an infirmity not inconsistent with the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_32_5" id="PgLn_32_5"></a><a href="#Goliath_of_Gath">{5}</a></span><br />
deranged state of his mind, seems to have altogether<br />
forgotten him.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>From this time began David's public life; but<br />
not yet the fulfillment of the promise made to him<br />
by Samuel. He had a second and severer trial<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_32_10" id="PgLn_32_10">{10}</a></span><br />
of patience to endure for many years; the trial<br />
of "being still" and doing nothing before God's<br />
time, though he had (apparently) the means in his<br />
hands of accomplishing the promise for himself.<br />
It was to this trial that Jeroboam afterwards<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_32_15" id="PgLn_32_15">{15}</a></span><br />
showed himself unequal. He, too, was promised<br />
a kingdom, but he was tempted to seize upon it<br />
in his own way, and so forfeited God's protection.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>David's victory over Goliath so endeared him<br />
to Saul, that he would not let him go back to his<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_32_20" id="PgLn_32_20">{20}</a></span><br />
father's house. Jonathan, too, Saul's son, at once<br />
felt for him a warm affection, which deepened into<br />
a firm friendship. "Saul set him over the men<br />
of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the<br />
people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a><span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_32_25" id="PgLn_32_25">{25}</a></span><br />
This prosperous fortune, however, did not long<br />
continue. As Saul passed through the cities from<br />
his victory over his enemies, the women of Israel<br />
came out to meet him, singing and dancing, and<br />
they said, "Saul hath slain his thousands, and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_32_30" id="PgLn_32_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>David his ten thousands." Immediately the<br />
jealous king was "very wroth, and the saying<br />
displeased him"; his sullenness returned; he<br />
feared David as a rival; and "eyed him from that<br />
day and forward." On the morrow, as David<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_33_5" id="PgLn_33_5">{5}</a></span><br />
was playing before him, as at other times, Saul<br />
threw his javelin at him. After this, Saul<br />
displaced him from his situation at his court, and<br />
sent him to the war, hoping so to rid himself of<br />
him by his falling in battle; but, by God's<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_33_10" id="PgLn_33_10">{10}</a></span><br />
blessing, David returned victorious.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>In a second war with the Philistines, David was<br />
successful as before; and Saul, overcome with<br />

with his javelin, as he played before him, with the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_33_15" id="PgLn_33_15">{15}</a></span><br />
hope of killing him.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>This repeated attempt on his life drove David<br />
from Saul's court; and for some years after, that<br />
is, till Saul's death, he was a wanderer upon the<br />
earth, persecuted in that country which was<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_33_20" id="PgLn_33_20">{20}</a></span><br />
afterwards to be his own kingdom. Here, as in his<br />
victory over Goliath, Almighty God purposed to<br />
show us, that it was <i>His</i> hand which set David on<br />
the throne of Israel. David conquered his enemy<br />
by a sling and stone, in order, as he said at the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_33_25" id="PgLn_33_25">{25}</a></span><br />
time, that all ... might know "that the Lord<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>refrained himself and used them not, though he<br />
possessed them. Like Abraham, he traversed<br />
the land of promise "as a strange land,"<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> waiting<br />
for God's good time. Nay, far more exactly, even<br />
than to Abraham, was it given to David to act and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_34_5" id="PgLn_34_5"></a><a href="#he_Apostle">{5}</a></span><br />
suffer that life of faith which the Apostle describes,<br />
and by which "the elders obtained a good report."<br />
By faith he wandered about, "being destitute,<br />
afflicted, evil-entreated, in deserts, and in<br />
mountains, and in dens, and in caves of the earth."<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_34_10" id="PgLn_34_10">{10}</a></span><br />
On the other hand, through the same faith, he<br />
"subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness,<br />
obtained promises, waxed valiant in fight, turned to<br />
flight the armies of the aliens."<br /></p></blockquote>

That character is ascertained and sealed by the<br />
plain word of Scripture, by the praise of Almighty<br />

find in it traits which we cannot fully reconcile<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_35_20" id="PgLn_35_20">{20}</a></span><br />
with the approbation divinely given to him, we<br />
must take it in faith to be what it is said to be,<br />
and wait for the future revelations of Him who<br />
"overcomes when He is judged." Therefore I<br />
dismiss these matters now, when I am engaged<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_35_25" id="PgLn_35_25">{25}</a></span><br />
in exhibiting the eminent obedience and<br />
manifold virtues of David. On the whole his situation<br />
during these years of trial was certainly that of a<br />
witness for Almighty God, one who does good and<br />
suffers for it, nay, suffers on rather than rid<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_35_30" id="PgLn_35_30">{30}</a></span><br />

<blockquote><p>This question may best be answered by<br />
considering the purpose for which he was raised up.<br />
When Saul was disobedient, Samuel said to him,<br />
"Thy kingdom shall not continue: the Lord hath<br />
sought Him <i>a man after His own heart</i>, and the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_36_10" id="PgLn_36_10">{10}</a></span><br />
Lord hath commanded him to be captain over<br />
His people, because thou hast not kept that which<br />
the Lord commanded thee."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The office to<br />
which first Saul and then David were called was<br />
different from that with which other favored<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_36_15" id="PgLn_36_15"></a><a href="#From_Moses">{15}</a></span><br />
men before them had been entrusted. From the<br />
time of Moses, when Israel became a nation, God<br />
had been the king of Israel, and His chosen<br />
servants, not delegates, but mere organs of His<br />
will. Moses did not direct the Israelites by his<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_36_20" id="PgLn_36_20">{20}</a></span><br />
own wisdom, but he spake to them, as God spake<br />
from the pillar of the cloud. Joshua, again, was<br />
merely a sword in the hand of God. Samuel was<br />
but His minister and interpreter. God acted, the<br />
Israelites "stood still and saw" His miracles, then<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_36_25" id="PgLn_36_25">{25}</a></span><br />
followed. But, when they had rejected Him<br />
from being king over them, then their chief ruler<br />
was no longer a mere organ of His power and will,<br />
but had a certain authority intrusted to him,<br />
more or less independent of supernatural direction;<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_36_30" id="PgLn_36_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>and acted, not so much <i>from</i> God, as <i>for</i><br />
God, and <i>in the place of</i> God. David, when taken<br />
from the sheepfolds "to feed Jacob His people and<br />
Israel His inheritance," "fed them," in the words<br />
of the Psalm, "with a faithful and true heart;<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_37_5" id="PgLn_37_5">{5}</a></span><br />
and ruled them prudently with all his power."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a><br />
From this account of his office, it is obvious that<br />
his very first duty was that of <i>fidelity to Almighty<br />
God</i> in the trust committed to him. He had<br />
power put into his hands, in a sense in which<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_37_10" id="PgLn_37_10">{10}</a></span><br />
neither Moses had it nor Samuel. He was charged<br />
with a certain office, which he was bound to<br />
administer according to his ability, so as best to<br />
promote the interests of Him who appointed him.<br />
Saul had neglected his Master's honor; but<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_37_15" id="PgLn_37_15">{15}</a></span><br />
David, in this an eminent type of Christ, "came<br />
to do God's will" as a viceroy in Israel, and, as<br />
being tried and found faithful, he is especially<br />
called "a man after God's own heart."<br /></p></blockquote>

illustrated in the early years of his life which have<br />

him and nothing more;&mdash;having borne this trial<br />

<blockquote><p>Observe how David was tried, and what<br />
various high qualities of mind he displayed in<br />
the course of the trial. First, the promise of<br />
greatness was given him, and Samuel anointed<br />
him. Still he stayed in the sheepfolds; and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_38_10" id="PgLn_38_10">{10}</a></span><br />
though called away by Saul for a time, yet<br />
returned contentedly when Saul released him from<br />

refrain themselves, till God make a way for their<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_38_15" id="PgLn_38_15">{15}</a></span><br />
use! and the trial would be the more severe in<br />
David's case, in proportion to the ardor and<br />
energy of his mind; yet he fainted not under it.<br />
Afterwards for seven years, as the time appears<br />
to be, he withstood the strong temptation, ever<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_38_20" id="PgLn_38_20"></a><a href="#The_kings_son-in-law">{20}</a></span><br />
before his eyes, of acting without God's guidance,<br />

Saul, who not only continually sought his life,<br />

by accusing him of treason, and whose life was<br />
several times in his hands, yet he kept his<br />
honor pure and unimpeachable. He feared God<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_38_30" id="PgLn_38_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>and honored the king; and this at a time of<br />
life especially exposed to the temptations of<br />
ambition.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>There is a resemblance between the early<br />
history of David and that of Joseph. Both<br />
distinguished for piety in youth, the youngest and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_39_5" id="PgLn_39_5"></a><a href="#David_and_Joseph">{5}</a></span><br />
the despised of their respective brethren, they<br />
are raised, after a long trial to a high station,<br />
as ministers of God's Providence. Joseph was<br />
tempted to a degrading adultery; David was<br />
tempted by ambition. Both were tempted to<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_39_10" id="PgLn_39_10">{10}</a></span><br />
be traitors to their masters and benefactors.<br />
Joseph's trial was brief; but his conduct under it<br />
evidenced settled habits of virtue which he could<br />
call to his aid at a moment's notice. A long<br />
imprisonment followed, the consequence of his<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_39_15" id="PgLn_39_15">{15}</a></span><br />
obedience, and borne with meekness and patience;<br />
but it was no part of his temptation, because,<br />
when once incurred, release was out of his power.<br />
David's trial, on the other hand, lasted for years,<br />
and grew stronger as time went on. His master,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_39_20" id="PgLn_39_20">{20}</a></span><br />

hand,"<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> sought his life. Continual opportunity<br />
of avenging himself incited his passions;<br />
self-defense, and the Divine promise, were specious<br />
arguments to seduce his reason. Yet he mastered<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_39_25" id="PgLn_39_25">{25}</a></span><br />
his heart&mdash;he was "still"; he kept his hands clean<br />

After he had done it, his "heart smote him" even<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_41_10" id="PgLn_41_10">{10}</a></span><br />
for this slight freedom, as if it were a disrespect<br />

the cave, David followed him and cried, "My<br />

him, David stooped with his face to the earth<br />
and bowed himself." He hoped that he could<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_41_20" id="PgLn_41_20">{20}</a></span><br />
now convince Saul of his integrity. "Wherefore<br />
hearest thou men's words," he asked, "saying,<br />

after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog,<br />
after a flea. The Lord therefore judge ... and<br />

he said, "Is this thy voice, my son David? and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_42_10" id="PgLn_42_10">{10}</a></span><br />

be guiltless?"<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Then, as he stood over him, he<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_42_20" id="PgLn_42_20">{20}</a></span><br />

fortunes, while he himself refrained from<br />

retired from the enemy's camp; and when at a safe<br />

for their negligent watch, which had allowed a<br />

was moved the second time; the miserable man,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_42_30" id="PgLn_42_30">{30}</a></span><br />

him, said, "I have sinned; return, my son David<br />

prudence, patience, instinctive tact and decision<br />
in conducting matters, as well as boldness and<br />
zeal. Such in a measure we may imagine the<br />
single-minded, the intrepid, the much-enduring<br />
Hildebrand, who, at a time when society was<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_45_15" id="PgLn_45_15"></a><a href="#City_of_God">{15}</a></span><br />
forming itself anew, was the Saviour, humanly<br />
speaking, of the City of God. Such, in an earlier age,<br />
was the majestic Ambrose; such the<br />
never-wearied Athanasius. These last-named<br />
luminaries of the Church came into public life early,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_45_20" id="PgLn_45_20"></a><a href="#Ambrose">{20}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>and thus learned how to cope with the various<br />
tempers, views, and measures of the men they<br />
encountered there. Athanasius was but<br />
twenty-seven when he went with Alexander to the Nicene<br />
Council, and the year after he was Bishop of<br />
Alexandria. Ambrose was consecrated soon after<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_46_5" id="PgLn_46_5">{5}</a></span><br />
the age of thirty.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Again, there is an instrument in the hand of<br />
Providence, of less elaborate and splendid<br />

so to call them, yet not less beautiful in its<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_46_10" id="PgLn_46_10">{10}</a></span><br />
texture, nor less precious in its material. Such is<br />
the retired and thoughtful student, who remains<br />
years and years in the solitude of a college or a<br />
monastery, chastening his soul in secret, raising<br />
it to high thought and single-minded purpose,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_46_15" id="PgLn_46_15">{15}</a></span><br />
and when at length called into active life,<br />
conducting himself with firmness, guilelessness, zeal<br />
like a flaming fire, and all the sweetness of purity<br />
and integrity. Such an one is often unsuccessful<br />
in his own day; he is too artless to persuade, too<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_46_20" id="PgLn_46_20">{20}</a></span><br />
severe to please; unskilled in the weaknesses of<br />
human nature, unfurnished in the resources of<br />
ready wit, negligent of men's applause,<br />
unsuspicious, open-hearted, he does his work, and so<br />
leaves it; and it seems to die; but in the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_46_25" id="PgLn_46_25">{25}</a></span><br />
generation after him it lives again, and on the long run<br />
it is difficult to say which of the two classes of<br />
men has served the cause of truth the more<br />
effectually. Such, perhaps, was Basil, who issued<br />
from the solitudes of Pontus to rule like a king,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_46_30" id="PgLn_46_30"></a><a href="#Cappadocia">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>and minister like the lowest in the kingdom; yet<br />
to meet little but disappointment, and to quit<br />
life prematurely in pain and sorrow. Such was<br />
his friend, the accomplished Gregory, however<br />
different in other respects from him, who left his<br />
father's roof for an heretical city, raised a church<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_47_5" id="PgLn_47_5">{5}</a></span><br />
there, and was driven back into retirement by<br />
his own people, as soon as his triumph over the<br />
false creed was secured. Such, perhaps, St. Peter<br />
Damiani in the middle age; such St. Anselm,<br />
such St. Edmund. No comparison is, of course,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_47_10" id="PgLn_47_10">{10}</a></span><br />
attempted here between the religious excellence<br />
of the two descriptions of men; each of them<br />
serves God according to the peculiar gifts given<br />
to him. If we might continue our instances<br />
by way of comparison, we should say that St.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_47_15" id="PgLn_47_15">{15}</a></span><br />
Paul reminds us of the former, and Jeremiah of<br />
the latter....<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>It often happens that men of very dissimilar<br />
talents and tastes are attracted together by their<br />
very dissimilitude. They live in intimacy for a<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_47_20" id="PgLn_47_20">{20}</a></span><br />
time, perhaps a long time, till their circumstances<br />
alter, or some sudden event comes, to try them.<br />
Then the peculiarities of their respective minds<br />
are brought out into action; and quarrels ensue,<br />
which end in coolness or separation. It would<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_47_25" id="PgLn_47_25"></a><a href="#The_contention">{25}</a></span><br />
not be right or true to say that this is exemplified<br />
in the instance of the two blessed Apostles, whose<br />
"sharp contention" is related in the Book of<br />
Acts; for they had been united in spirit once for<br />
all by a Divine gift; and yet their strife reminds<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_47_30" id="PgLn_47_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>us of what takes place in life continually. And it<br />
so far resembled the everyday quarrels of friends,<br />
in that it arose from difference of temper and<br />
character in those favored servants of God.<br />
The zealous heart of the Apostle of the Gentiles<br />
endured not the presence of one who had swerved<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_48_5" id="PgLn_48_5">{5}</a></span><br />
in his course; the indulgent spirit of Barnabas<br />
felt that a first fault ought not to be a last trial.<br />
Such are the two main characters which are found<br />
in the Church,&mdash;high energy, and sweetness of<br />
temper; far from incompatible, of course, united<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_48_10" id="PgLn_48_10">{10}</a></span><br />
in Apostles, though in different relative<br />
proportions, yet only partially combined in ordinary<br />
Christians, and often altogether parted from each<br />
other.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>This contrast of character, leading, first, to<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_48_15" id="PgLn_48_15">{15}</a></span><br />
intimacy, then to differences, is interestingly<br />
displayed, though painfully, in one passage of the<br />
history of Basil and Gregory: Gregory the<br />
affectionate, the tender-hearted, the man of quick<br />
feelings, the accomplished, the eloquent<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_48_20" id="PgLn_48_20">{20}</a></span><br />
preacher,&mdash;and Basil, the man of firm resolve and hard<br />
deeds, the high-minded ruler of Christ's flock,<br />
the diligent laborer in the field of ecclesiastical<br />
politics. Thus they differed; yet not as if they<br />
had not much in common still; both had the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_48_25" id="PgLn_48_25">{25}</a></span><br />
blessing and the discomfort of a sensitive mind;<br />
both were devoted to an ascetic life; both were<br />
men of classical tastes; both were special<br />
champions of the Catholic creed; both were skilled<br />
in argument, and successful in their use of it;<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_48_30" id="PgLn_48_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>both were in highest place in the Church, the one<br />
Exarch of Csarea, the other Patriarch of<br />
Constantinople. I will now attempt to sketch the<br />
history of their intimacy.<br /></p></blockquote>

<p class="center">II</p>

<blockquote><p>Basil and Gregory were both natives of<br />
Cappadocia, but here, again, under different<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_49_5" id="PgLn_49_5">{5}</a></span><br />
circumstances; Basil was born of a good family, and<br />
with Christian ancestors: Gregory was the son of<br />
the Bishop of Nazianzus, who had been brought<br />
up an idolater, or rather an Hypsistarian, a<br />
mongrel sort of religionist, part Jew, part Pagan.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_49_10" id="PgLn_49_10">{10}</a></span><br />
He was brought over to Christianity by the efforts<br />
of his wife Nonna, and at Nazianzus admitted by<br />
baptism into the Church. In process of time he<br />
was made bishop of that city; but not having a<br />
very firm hold of the faith, he was betrayed in<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_49_15" id="PgLn_49_15"></a><a href="#Armenian_creed">{15}</a></span><br />
360 into signing the Ariminian creed, which caused<br />
him much trouble, and from which at length his<br />
son recovered him. Csarea being at no<br />
unsurmountable distance from Nazianzus, the two<br />
friends had known each other in their own country;<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_49_20" id="PgLn_49_20">{20}</a></span><br />
but their intimacy began at Athens, whither<br />
they separately repaired for the purposes of<br />
education. This was about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 350, when each of<br />
them was twenty-one years of age. Gregory<br />
came to the seat of learning shortly before Basil,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_49_25" id="PgLn_49_25">{25}</a></span><br />
and thus was able to be his host and guide on his<br />
arrival; but fame had reported Basil's merits<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>before he came, and he seems to have made his<br />
way, in a place of all others most difficult to a<br />
stranger, with a facility peculiar to himself. He<br />
soon found himself admired and respected by<br />
his fellow-students; but Gregory was his only<br />
friend, and shared with him the reputation of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_50_5" id="PgLn_50_5">{5}</a></span><br />
talents and attainments. They remained at<br />
Athens four or five years; and, at the end of the<br />
time, made the acquaintance of Julian, since of<br />
evil name in history as the Apostate. Gregory<br />
thus describes in after life his early intimacy<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_50_10" id="PgLn_50_10">{10}</a></span><br />
with Basil:<br /></p></blockquote>

under these circumstances that they took the<br />

entreated them to stay.<br /></p></blockquote>

them, and resisted their departure by entreaties,<br />
arguments, and even by violence. This occasion<br />
showed, also, their respective dispositions; for<br />

longer. Basil, indeed, in spite of the reputation<br />

philosophy and literature; and seems to have given up<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>leave the world, not to insist on his love of Basil's<br />

which runs thus in prose, "a dream came to me, which<br />
drew me readily to the desire of chastity. Two virgin<br />
forms, in white garments, seemed to shine close to me.<br />
Both were fair and of one age, and their ornament lay<br />
in their want of ornament, which is a woman's beauty.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_53_10" id="PgLn_53_10">{10}</a></span><br />
No gold adorned their neck, nor jacinth; nor had they<br />
the delicate spinning of the silkworm. Their fair robe<br />
was bound with a girdle, and it reached down to their<br />
ankles. Their head and face were concealed by a veil,<br />
and their eyes were fixed on the ground. The fair glow<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_53_15" id="PgLn_53_15">{15}</a></span><br />
of modesty was on both of them, as far as could be seen<br />
under their thick covering. Their lips were closed in<br />
silence, as the rose in its dewy leaves. When I saw<br />
them, I rejoiced much; for I said that they were far<br />
more than mortals. And they in turn kept kissing me,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_53_20" id="PgLn_53_20">{20}</a></span><br />
while I drew light from their lips, fondling me as a dear<br />
son. And when I asked who and whence the women<br />
were, the one answered, 'Purity,' the other, 'Sobriety';<br />
'We stand by Christ, the King, and delight in the beauty<br />
of the celestial virgins. Come, then, child, unite thy<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_53_25" id="PgLn_53_25">{25}</a></span><br />
mind to our mind, thy light to our light; so shall we carry<br />
thee aloft in all brightness through the air, and place<br />
thee by the radiance of the immortal Trinity.'"<br />

<blockquote><p>He goes on to say, that he never lost the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_53_30" id="PgLn_53_30">{30}</a></span><br />
impression this made upon him, as "a spark of<br />
heavenly fire," or "a taste of divine milk and<br />
honey."<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>As far, then, as these descriptions go, one might<br />
say that Gregory's abandonment of the world<br />
arose from an early passion, as it may be called,<br />
for a purity higher than his own nature; and<br />
Basil's, from a profound sense of the world's<br />
nothingness and the world's defilements. Both<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_54_5" id="PgLn_54_5">{5}</a></span><br />
seem to have viewed it as a sort of penitential<br />
exercise, as well as a means towards perfection.<br /></p></blockquote>

themselves to the service of religion, the question<br />
arose, how they might best improve and employ<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_54_10" id="PgLn_54_10">{10}</a></span><br />
the talents committed to them. Somehow, the<br />
idea of marrying and taking orders, or taking<br />
orders and marrying, building or improving their<br />
parsonages, and showing forth the charities, the<br />
humanities, and the gentilities of a family man,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_54_15" id="PgLn_54_15">{15}</a></span><br />
did not suggest itself to their minds. They fancied<br />
that they must give up wife, children, property,<br />
if they would be perfect; and, this being taken<br />
for granted, that their choice lay between two<br />
modes of life, both of which they regarded as<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_54_20" id="PgLn_54_20">{20}</a></span><br />
extremes. Here, then, for a time, they were in<br />
some perplexity. Gregory speaks of two ascetic<br />
disciplines, that of the solitary or hermit, and that<br />
of the secular;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> one of which, he says, profits<br />
a man's self, the other his neighbor. Midway,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_54_25" id="PgLn_54_25">{25}</a></span><br />
however, between these lay the C&oelig;nobite, or<br />
what we commonly call the monastic; removed<br />
from the world, yet acting in a certain select<br />
circle. And this was the rule which the friends<br />
at length determined to adopt, withdrawing from<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_54_30" id="PgLn_54_30">{30}</a></span><br />

<blockquote><p>Though it may not be given us to appropriate<br />
the prophecies of the Apocalypse to the real<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_56_15" id="PgLn_56_15"></a><a href="#Apocalypse">{15}</a></span><br />
events to which they belong, yet it is impossible<br />
to read its inspired pages, and then to turn to<br />
the dissolution of the Roman empire, without<br />
seeing a remarkable agreement, on the whole,<br />
between the calamities of that period and the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_56_20" id="PgLn_56_20">{20}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>sacred prediction. There is a plain announcement<br />
in the inspired page, of "Woe, woe, woe, to<br />
the inhabitants of the earth"; an announcement<br />
of "hail and fire mingled with blood," the<br />
conflagration of "trees and green grass," the<br />
destruction of ships, the darkening of the sun, and the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_57_5" id="PgLn_57_5">{5}</a></span><br />
poisoning of the rivers over a third of their course.<br />
There is a clear prophecy of revolutions on the<br />
face of the earth and in the structure of society.<br />
And, on the other hand, let us observe how fully<br />
such general foretokenings are borne out, among<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_57_10" id="PgLn_57_10">{10}</a></span><br />
other passages of history, in the Vandalic<br />
conquest of Africa.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The coast of Africa, between the great desert<br />
and the Mediterranean, was one of the most<br />
fruitful and opulent portions of the Roman world.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_57_15" id="PgLn_57_15">{15}</a></span><br />
The eastern extremity of it was more especially<br />
connected with the empire, containing in it<br />
Carthage, Hippo, and other towns, celebrated as<br />
being sees of the Christian Church, as well as<br />
places of civil importance. In the spring of the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_57_20" id="PgLn_57_20"></a><a href="#The_Vandals">{20}</a></span><br />
year 428, the Vandals, Arians by creed, and<br />
barbarians by birth and disposition, crossed the<br />
Straits of Gibraltar, and proceeded along this<br />
fertile district, bringing with them devastation<br />
and captivity on every side. They abandoned<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_57_25" id="PgLn_57_25">{25}</a></span><br />
themselves to the most savage cruelties and<br />
excesses. They pillaged, ravaged, burned,<br />
massacred all that came in their way, sparing not even<br />
the fruit trees, which might have afforded some<br />
poor food to the remnant of the population, who<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_57_30" id="PgLn_57_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>had escaped from them into caves, the recesses<br />
of the mountains, or into vaults. Twice did this<br />
desolating pestilence sweep over the face of the<br />
country.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The fury of the Vandals was especially exercised<br />
towards the memorials of religion. Churches,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_58_5" id="PgLn_58_5">{5}</a></span><br />
cemeteries, monasteries, were objects of their<br />
fiercest hatred and most violent assaults. They<br />
broke into the places of worship, cut to pieces all<br />
internal decorations, and then set fire to them.<br />
They tortured bishops and clergy with the hope of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_58_10" id="PgLn_58_10">{10}</a></span><br />
obtaining treasure. The names of some of the<br />
victims of their ferocity are preserved. Mansuetus,<br />
Bishop of Utica, was burnt alive; Papinianus,<br />
Bishop of Vite, was laid upon red-hot plates of<br />
iron. This was near upon the time when the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_58_15" id="PgLn_58_15">{15}</a></span><br />
third General Council was assembling at Ephesus,<br />
which, from the insecure state of the roads, and<br />
the universal misery which reigned among them,<br />
the African bishops were prevented from<br />
attending. The Clergy, the religious brotherhoods, the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_58_20" id="PgLn_58_20">{20}</a></span><br />
holy virgins, were scattered all over the country.<br />
The daily sacrifice was stopped, the sacraments<br />
could not be obtained, the festivals of the Church<br />
passed unnoticed. At length, only three cities<br />
remained unvisited by the general<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_58_25" id="PgLn_58_25">{25}</a></span><br />
desolation,&mdash;Carthage, Hippo, and Cirtha.<br /></p></blockquote>

<p class="center">II</p>

<blockquote><p>Hippo was the see of St. Austin, then<br />
seventy-four years of age (forty almost of which had been<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>passed in ministerial labors), and warned, by<br />
the law of nature, of the approach of dissolution.<br />
It was as if the light of prosperity and peace<br />
were fading away from the African Church, as<br />
sank the bodily powers of its great earthly<br />
ornament and stay. At this time, when the terrors<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_59_5" id="PgLn_59_5"></a><a href="#The_argument">{5}</a></span><br />
of the barbaric invasion spread on all sides, a<br />
bishop wrote to him to ask whether it was allowable<br />
for the ruler of a Church to leave the scene of his<br />
pastoral duties in order to save his life.<br />
Different opinions had heretofore been expressed on<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_59_10" id="PgLn_59_10"></a><a href="#Montanists">{10}</a></span><br />
this question. In Augustine's own country<br />
Tertullian had maintained that flight was unlawful,<br />
but he was a Montanist when he so wrote. On<br />
the other hand, Cyprian had actually fled, and<br />
had defended his conduct when questioned by<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_59_15" id="PgLn_59_15">{15}</a></span><br />
the clergy of Rome. His contemporaries,<br />
Dionysius of Alexandria, and Gregory of Neocsarea,<br />
had fled also; as had Polycarp before them, and<br />
Athanasius after them.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Athanasius also had to defend his flight, and he<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_59_20" id="PgLn_59_20">{20}</a></span><br />
defended it, in a work still extant, thus: First,<br />
he observes, it has the sanction of numerous<br />
Scripture precedents. Thus, in the instance of<br />
confessors under the old covenant, Jacob fled<br />
from Esau, Moses from Pharao, David from Saul;<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_59_25" id="PgLn_59_25">{25}</a></span><br />
Elias concealed himself from Achab three years,<br />
and the sons of the prophets were hid by Abdias<br />
in a cave from Jezebel. In like manner under<br />
the Gospel, the disciples hid themselves for fear<br />
of the Jews, and St. Paul was let down in a basket<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_59_30" id="PgLn_59_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>over the wall at Damascus. On the other hand,<br />
no instance can be adduced of overboldness and<br />
headstrong daring in the saints of Scripture.<br />
But our Lord Himself is the chief exemplar of<br />
fleeing from persecution. As a child in arms He<br />
had to flee into Egypt. When He returned, He<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_60_5" id="PgLn_60_5">{5}</a></span><br />
still shunned Judea, and retired to Nazareth.<br />
After raising Lazarus, on the Jews seeking His<br />
life, "He walked no more openly among them,"<br />
but retreated to the neighborhood of the desert.<br />
When they took up stones to cast at Him, He<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_60_10" id="PgLn_60_10">{10}</a></span><br />
hid Himself; when they attempted to cast Him<br />
down headlong, He made His way through them;<br />
when He heard of the Baptist's death, He retired<br />
across the lake into a desert place, apart. If it<br />
be said that He did so, because His time was not<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_60_15" id="PgLn_60_15">{15}</a></span><br />
yet come, and that when it was come, He<br />
delivered up Himself, we must ask, in reply, how a<br />
man can know that his time is come, so as to<br />
have a right to act as Christ acted? And since<br />
we do not know, we must have patience; and,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_60_20" id="PgLn_60_20">{20}</a></span><br />
till God by His own act determines the time, we<br />
must "wander in sheepskins and goatskins,"<br />
rather than take the matter into our own hands;<br />
as even Saul, the persecutor, was left by David<br />
in the hands of God, whether He would "strike<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_60_25" id="PgLn_60_25">{25}</a></span><br />
him, or his day should come to die, or he should<br />
go down to battle and perish."<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>If God's servants, proceeds Athanasius, have<br />
at any time presented themselves before their<br />
persecutors, it was at God's command: thus Elias<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_60_30" id="PgLn_60_30"></a><a href="#The_prophet">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>showed himself to Achab; so did the prophet<br />
from Juda, to Jeroboam; and St. Paul appealed<br />
to Csar. Flight, so far from implying<br />
cowardice, requires often greater courage than not to<br />
flee. It is a greater trial of heart. Death is an<br />
end of all trouble; he who flees is ever expecting<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_61_5" id="PgLn_61_5">{5}</a></span><br />
death, and dies daily. Job's life was not to be<br />
touched by Satan, yet was not his fortitude<br />
shown in what he suffered? Exile is full of<br />
miseries. The after-conduct of the saints showed<br />
they had not fled for fear. Jacob, on his<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_61_10" id="PgLn_61_10">{10}</a></span><br />
death-bed, contemned death, and blessed each of the<br />
twelve Patriarchs; Moses returned, and<br />
presented himself before Pharao; David was a<br />
valiant warrior; Elias rebuked Achab and<br />
Ochazias; Peter and Paul, who had once hid<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_61_15" id="PgLn_61_15">{15}</a></span><br />
themselves, offered themselves to martyrdom at<br />
Rome. And so acceptable was the previous<br />
flight of these men to Almighty God, that we<br />
read of His showing them some special favor<br />
during it. Then it was that Jacob had the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_61_20" id="PgLn_61_20">{20}</a></span><br />
vision of Angels; Moses saw the burning bush;<br />
David wrote his prophetic Psalms; Elias raised<br />
the dead, and gathered the people on Mount<br />
Carmel. How would the Gospel ever have been<br />
preached throughout the world, if the Apostles<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_61_25" id="PgLn_61_25">{25}</a></span><br />
had not fled? And, since their time, those, too,<br />
who have become martyrs, at first fled; or, if they<br />
advanced to meet their persecutors, it was by<br />
some secret suggestion of the Divine Spirit. But,<br />
above all, while these instances abundantly<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_61_30" id="PgLn_61_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>illustrate the rule of duty in persecution, and the<br />
temper of mind necessary in those who observe<br />
it, we have that duty itself declared in a plain<br />
precept by no other than our Lord: "When they<br />
shall persecute you in this city," He says, "flee<br />
into another;" and "let them that are in Judea<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_62_5" id="PgLn_62_5">{5}</a></span><br />
flee unto the mountains."<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Thus argues the great Athanasius, living in<br />
spirit with the saints departed, while full of<br />
labor and care here on earth. For the<br />
arguments on the other side, let us turn to a writer,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_62_10" id="PgLn_62_10">{10}</a></span><br />
not less vigorous in mind, but less subdued in<br />
temper. Thus writes Tertullian on the same<br />
subject, then a Montanist, a century and a half<br />
earlier: Nothing happens, he says, without<br />
God's will. Persecution is sent by Him, to put<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_62_15" id="PgLn_62_15">{15}</a></span><br />
His servants to the test; to divide between good<br />
and bad: it is a trial; what man has any right<br />
to interfere? He who gives the prize, alone can<br />
assign the combat. Persecution is more than<br />
permitted, it is actually appointed by Almighty<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_62_20" id="PgLn_62_20">{20}</a></span><br />
God. It does the Church much good, as leading<br />
Christians to increased seriousness while it lasts.<br />
It comes and goes at God's ordering. Satan<br />
could not touch Job, except so far as God gave<br />
permission. He could not touch the Apostles,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_62_25" id="PgLn_62_25">{25}</a></span><br />
except as far as an opening was allowed in the<br />
words, "Satan hath desired to have you, but I<br />
have prayed for thee," Peter, "and thou, being<br />
once converted, confirm thy brethren." We<br />
pray, "Lead us not into temptation, but deliver<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_62_30" id="PgLn_62_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>us from evil;" why, if we may deliver ourselves?<br />
Satan is permitted access to us, either for<br />
punishment, as in Saul's case, or for our chastisement.<br />
Since the persecution comes from God, we may<br />
not lawfully avoid it, nor can we avoid it. We<br />
cannot, because He is all powerful; we must not,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_63_5" id="PgLn_63_5">{5}</a></span><br />
because He is all good. We should leave the<br />
matter entirely to God. As to the command of<br />
fleeing from city to city, this was temporary. It<br />
was intended to secure the preaching of the<br />
Gospel to the nations. While the Apostles preached<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_63_10" id="PgLn_63_10">{10}</a></span><br />
to the Jews,&mdash;till they had preached to the<br />
Gentiles,&mdash;they were to flee; but one might as<br />
well argue, that we now are not to go "into the<br />
way of the Gentiles," but to confine ourselves<br />
to "the lost sheep of the house of Israel," as that<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_63_15" id="PgLn_63_15">{15}</a></span><br />
we are now to "flee from city to city." Nor,<br />
indeed, was going from city to city a flight; it was<br />
a continued preaching; not an accident, but a<br />
rule: whether persecuted or not, they were to go<br />
about; and before they had gone through the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_63_20" id="PgLn_63_20">{20}</a></span><br />
cities of Israel, the Lord was to come. The<br />
command contemplated only those very cities.<br />
If St. Paul escaped out of "Damascus by night,<br />
yet afterwards, against the prayers of the disciples<br />
and the prophecy of Agabus, he went up to<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_63_25" id="PgLn_63_25">{25}</a></span><br />
Jerusalem. Thus the command to flee did not last<br />
even through the lifetime of the Apostles; and,<br />
indeed, why should God introduce persecution,<br />
if He bids us retire from it? This is imputing<br />
inconsistency to His acts. If we want texts to<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_63_30" id="PgLn_63_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>justify our not fleeing, He says, "Whoso shall<br />
confess Me before men, I will confess him before<br />
My Father." "Blessed are they that suffer<br />
persecution;" "He that shall persevere to the end,<br />
he shall be saved;" "Be not afraid of them that<br />
kill the body;" "Whosoever does not carry his<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_64_5" id="PgLn_64_5">{5}</a></span><br />
cross and come after Me, cannot be My disciple."<br />
How are these texts fulfilled when a man flees.<br />
Christ, who is our pattern, did not more than<br />
pray, "If it be possible, let this chalice pass:"<br />
we, too, should both stay and pray as He did.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_64_10" id="PgLn_64_10">{10}</a></span><br />
And it is expressly told us, that "We also ought<br />
to lay down our lives for the brethren." Again, it<br />
is said, "Perfect charity casteth out fear;" he<br />
who flees, fears; he who fears, "is not perfected<br />
in charity." The Greek proverb is sometimes<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_64_15" id="PgLn_64_15">{15}</a></span><br />
urged, "He who flees, will fight another day;"<br />
yes, and he may flee another day, also. Again,<br />
if bishops, priests, and deacons flee, why must<br />
the laity stay? or must they flee also? "The<br />
good shepherd," on the contrary, "layeth down<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_64_20" id="PgLn_64_20">{20}</a></span><br />
his life for his sheep"; whereas, the bad shepherd<br />
"seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep,<br />
and fleeth." At no time, as Jeremiah, Ezekiel,<br />
and Zechariah tell us, is the flock in greater<br />
danger of being scattered than when it loses its<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_64_25" id="PgLn_64_25">{25}</a></span><br />
shepherd. Tertullian ends thus: "This doctrine, my<br />
brother, perhaps appears to you hard; nay,<br />
intolerable. But recollect that God has said, 'He<br />
that can take, let him take it;' that is, he who<br />
receives it not, let him depart. He who fears to<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_64_30" id="PgLn_64_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>suffer cannot belong to Him who has suffered.<br />
He who does not fear to suffer is perfect in love,<br />
that is, of God. Many are called, few are chosen.<br />
Not he who would walk the broad way is sought<br />
out by God, but he who walks the narrow."<br />
Thus the ingenious and vehement Tertullian.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_65_5" id="PgLn_65_5">{5}</a></span><br /></p></blockquote>

sufficient, dear brother, without the task you put on me<br />

ask and answer, when I said that no persons were<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_65_20" id="PgLn_65_20">{20}</a></span><br />
hindered from retiring to such fortified places as they were<br />
able and desirous to secure; while, on the other hand, we<br />
might not break the bonds of our ministry, by which<br />
the love of Christ has engaged us not to desert the Church,<br />
where we are bound to serve. The following is what I<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_65_25" id="PgLn_65_25">{25}</a></span><br />
laid down in the letter I refer to: 'It remains, then,'<br />

is necessary to its staying, must say to the Lord,<br />
Thou art our strong rock and place of defense.'<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"But you tell me that this view is not sufficient for<br />
you, from an apprehension lest we should be running<br />
counter to our Lord's command and example, to flee<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_66_5" id="PgLn_66_5">{5}</a></span><br />
from city to city. Yet is it conceivable that He meant<br />
that our flocks, whom He bought with His own blood,<br />
should be deprived of that necessary ministration<br />
without which they cannot live? Is He a precedent for<br />
this, who was carried in flight into Egypt by His parents<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_66_10" id="PgLn_66_10">{10}</a></span><br />
when but a child, before He had formed Churches which<br />
we can talk of His leaving? Or, when St. Paul was let<br />
down in a basket through a window, lest the enemy<br />
should seize him, and so escaped his hands, was the Church<br />
of that place bereft of its necessary ministration, seeing<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_66_15" id="PgLn_66_15">{15}</a></span><br />
there were other brethren stationed there to fulfill what<br />
was necessary? Evidently it was their wish that he,<br />
who was the direct object of the persecutors' search,<br />
should preserve himself for the sake of the Church.<br />
Let then, the servants of Christ, the ministers of His<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_66_20" id="PgLn_66_20">{20}</a></span><br />
word and sacraments, do in such cases as He enjoined<br />

Church, but give meat to those their fellow-servants,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_66_25" id="PgLn_66_25">{25}</a></span><br />
who they know cannot live without it. But in a case<br />

reason for fleeing,&mdash;as in the case of St. Paul; or,<br />

together in Alexandria, were in no measure deserted by the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_67_25" id="PgLn_67_25">{25}</a></span><br />
other ministers. But when the people remain, and the<br />
ministers flee, and the ministration is suspended, what<br />
is that but the guilty flight of hirelings, who care not for<br />
the sheep? For then the wolf will come,&mdash;not man, but<br />
the devil, who is accustomed to persuade such believers<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_67_30" id="PgLn_67_30">{30}</a></span><br />
to apostasy, who are bereft of the daily ministration of<br />
the Lord's Body; and by your, not knowledge, but<br />
ignorance of duty, the weak brother will perish, for whom<br />
Christ died.<br /></p></blockquote>

preserve themselves for the profit of the Church for more<br />
tranquil times. I grant it where others are present to<br />

dying, and when the example of flight does more harm<br />
than the service of living does good, it is by no means<br />
to be done. To be brief, holy David withdrew himself<br />

to perish, unless some of them take to flight? or<br />
when persecution is set on foot only with the view<br />
of reaching the ministers of the Church? This<br />
leads him to exclaim:<br /></p></blockquote>

ministers, <i>who</i> are to remain, and <i>who</i> to flee, lest the<br />
Church should be deserted, whether by all fleeing or all<br />
dying! Surely there will ever be such a quarrel, where<br />
each party burns in its own charity, yet indulges the<br />
charity of the other. In such a difficulty, the lot seems<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_69_10" id="PgLn_69_10">{10}</a></span><br />
the fairest decision, in default of others. God judges<br />
better than man in perplexities of this sort; whether it<br />
be His will to reward the holier among them with the<br />
crown of martyrdom, and to spare the weak, or again,<br />
to strengthen the latter to endure evil, removing those<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_69_15" id="PgLn_69_15">{15}</a></span><br />
from life whom the Church of God can spare the better.<br />
Should it, however, seem inexpedient to cast<br />
lots,&mdash;a measure for which I cannot bring precedent,&mdash;at<br />
least, let no one's flight be the cause of the Church's<br />
losing those ministrations which, in such dangers, are<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_69_20" id="PgLn_69_20">{20}</a></span><br />
so necessary and so imperative. Let no one make<br />
himself an exception, on the plea of having some particular<br />
grace, which gives him a claim to life, and therefore to<br />
flight.<br /></p></blockquote>

their flocks into staying, by their example. But it is<br />

consists in the perverted and discordant action<br />
of the various faculties and functions of the soul,<br />
which have lost their legitimate governing power,<br />
and are unable to regain it, except at the hands<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_71_5" id="PgLn_71_5"></a><a href="#The_misery_of_irreligion">{5}</a></span><br />
of their Maker. Now the run of irreligious men<br />
do not suffer in any great degree from this<br />
disorder, and are not miserable; they have neither<br />
great talents nor strong passions; they have not<br />
within them the materials of rebellion in such<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_71_10" id="PgLn_71_10">{10}</a></span><br />
measure as to threaten their peace. They follow<br />
their own wishes, they yield to the bent of the<br />

various enough to be troublesome. Their minds<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_71_15" id="PgLn_71_15">{15}</a></span><br />
are in no sense under rule; but anarchy is not in<br />

not unlike the internal condition as it is reported<br />

which, though the government is weak or null,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_71_20" id="PgLn_71_20">{20}</a></span><br />
the body politic goes on without any great<br />
embarrassment or collision of its members one with<br />

very different when the moral and intellectual<br />

Then, if the governing power be feeble, all the<br />

suggest to us. Then we have before us the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_71_30" id="PgLn_71_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>melancholy spectacle of high aspirations without<br />
an aim, a hunger of the soul unsatisfied, and a<br />
never ending restlessness and inward warfare of<br />
its various faculties. Gifted minds, if not<br />

the case of a popular poet, an impressive instance<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_72_10" id="PgLn_72_10">{10}</a></span><br />
of a great genius throwing off the fear of God,<br />

his soul upon itself, and bitterly confessing and<br />
imparting his wretchedness to all around him.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_72_15" id="PgLn_72_15">{15}</a></span><br />
I have no wish at all to compare him to St.<br />
Augustine; indeed, if we may say it without<br />
presumption, the very different termination of their trial<br />
seems to indicate some great difference in their<br />
respective modes of encountering it. The one<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_72_20" id="PgLn_72_20">{20}</a></span><br />
dies of premature decay, to all appearance, a<br />
hardened infidel; and if he is still to have a name,<br />

blasphemous and immoral: the other is a Saint<br />
and Doctor of the Church. Each makes<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_72_25" id="PgLn_72_25">{25}</a></span><br />
confessions, the one to the saints, the other to the<br />
powers of evil. And does not the difference of<br />
the two discover itself in some measure, even to<br />
our eyes, in the very history of their wanderings<br />
and pinings? At least, there is no appearance in<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_72_30" id="PgLn_72_30">{30}</a></span><br />

to the strongest excitements, by way of relieving<br />
itself of the rush and violence of feelings, of which<br />

won by his kindness of manner, attended his<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_76_20" id="PgLn_76_20">{20}</a></span><br />
sermons with curiosity and interest. "I listened,"<br />
he says, "not in the frame of mind which became<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>of Faustus." Augustine was insensibly moved:<br />
he determined on leaving the Manichees, and<br />
returning to the state of a catechumen in the<br />
Catholic Church, into which he had been admitted<br />
by his parents. He began to eye and muse upon<br />
the great bishop of Milan more and more, and tried<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_77_5" id="PgLn_77_5">{5}</a></span><br />
in vain to penetrate his secret heart, and to<br />
ascertain the thoughts and feelings which swayed him.<br />

respect and intimacy of the great could make<br />
a man happy, these advantages he perceived<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_77_10" id="PgLn_77_10">{10}</a></span><br />
Ambrose to possess; yet he was not satisfied that<br />
he was a happy man. His celibacy seemed a<br />
drawback: what constituted his hidden life? or<br />
was he cold at heart? or was he of a famished<br />
and restless spirit? He felt his own malady, and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_77_15" id="PgLn_77_15">{15}</a></span><br />
longed to ask him some questions about it. But<br />
Ambrose could not easily be spoken with. Though<br />
accessible to all, yet that very circumstance<br />
made it difficult for an individual, especially one<br />
who was not of his flock, to get a private<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_77_20" id="PgLn_77_20">{20}</a></span><br />
interview with him. When he was not taken up with<br />
the Christian people who surrounded him, he<br />
was either at his meals or engaged in private<br />
reading. Augustine used to enter, as all persons<br />
might, without being announced; but after<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_77_25" id="PgLn_77_25">{25}</a></span><br />

procure them? Let set times be appointed, and<br />
certain hours be ordered for the health of our soul. Great<br />
hope has dawned; the Catholic faith teaches not what<br />
we thought; and do we doubt to knock, that the rest<br />
may be opened? The forenoons, indeed, our scholars <span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_78_20" id="PgLn_78_20">{20}</a></span><br />
take up; what do we during the rest of our time? why<br />
not this? But if so, when pay we court to our great<br />

<blockquote><p>Finding Ambrose, though kind and accessible,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_79_5" id="PgLn_79_5">{5}</a></span><br />
yet reserved, he went to an aged man named<br />
Simplician, who, as some say, baptized St.<br />
Ambrose, and eventually succeeded him in his<br />
see. He opened his mind to him, and<br />
happening in the course of his communications to<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_79_10" id="PgLn_79_10">{10}</a></span><br />
mention Victorinus's translation of some Platonic<br />
works, Simplician asked him if he knew that<br />
person's history. It seems he was a professor of<br />
rhetoric at Rome, was well versed in literature and<br />
philosophy, had been tutor to many of the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_79_15" id="PgLn_79_15">{15}</a></span><br />
senators, and had received the high honor of a statue<br />
in the Forum. Up to his old age he had<br />
professed, and defended with his eloquence, the old<br />
pagan worship. He was led to read the Holy<br />
Scriptures, and was brought, in consequence, to<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_79_20" id="PgLn_79_20"></a><a href="#Christianity_a_philosophy">{20}</a></span><br />
a belief in their divinity. For a while he did not<br />
feel the necessity of changing his profession; he<br />
looked upon Christianity as a philosophy, he<br />
embraced it as such, but did not propose to join<br />
what he considered the Christian sect, or, as<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_79_25" id="PgLn_79_25">{25}</a></span><br />
Christians would call it, the Catholic Church.<br />
He let Simplician into his secret; but whenever<br />
the latter pressed him to take the step, he was<br />
accustomed to ask, "whether walls made a<br />
Christian." However, such a state could not<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_79_30" id="PgLn_79_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>continue with a man of earnest mind: the leaven<br />
worked; at length he unexpectedly called upon<br />
Simplician to lead him to church. He was<br />
admitted a catechumen, and in due time baptized,<br />
"Rome wondering, the Church rejoicing." It<br />
was customary at Rome for the candidates for<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_80_5" id="PgLn_80_5">{5}</a></span><br />
baptism to profess their faith from a raised place<br />
in the church, in a set form of words. An offer<br />
was made to Victorinus, which was not unusual<br />
in the case of bashful and timid persons, to make<br />
his profession in private. But he preferred to<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_80_10" id="PgLn_80_10">{10}</a></span><br />
make it in the ordinary way. "I was public<br />
enough," he made answer, "in my profession of<br />
rhetoric, and ought not to be frightened when<br />
professing salvation." He continued the school<br />
which he had before he became a Christian, till<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_80_15" id="PgLn_80_15">{15}</a></span><br />
the edict of Julian forced him to close it. This<br />
story went to Augustine's heart, but it did not<br />
melt it. There was still the struggle of two wills,<br />
the high aspiration and the habitual inertness.<br />
His conversion took place in the summer of 386.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_80_20" id="PgLn_80_20">{20}</a></span><br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>He gives an account of the termination of the<br />
conflict he underwent:<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"At length burst forth a mighty storm, bringing<br />
a mighty flood of tears; and to indulge it to the full<br />
even unto cries, in solitude, I rose up from Alypius, ... <span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_80_25" id="PgLn_80_25">{25}</a></span><br />
who perceived from my choked voice how it was with<br />
me. He remained where we had been sitting, in deep<br />
astonishment. I threw myself down under a fig tree, I<br />
know not how, and allowing my tears full vent, offered<br />
up to Thee the acceptable sacrifice of my streaming eyes.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_80_30" id="PgLn_80_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span><br />
And I cried out to this effect: 'And Thou, O Lord,<br />
how long, how long, Lord, wilt Thou be angry?<br />
Forever? Remember not our old sins!' for I felt that they<br />
were my tyrants. I cried out, piteously, 'How long?<br />
how long? to-morrow and to-morrow? why not <i>now</i>?<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_81_5" id="PgLn_81_5">{5}</a></span><br />
why not in this very hour put an end to this my vileness?'<br />
While I thus spoke, with tears, in the bitter contrition<br />
of my heart, suddenly I heard a voice, as if from a house<br />
near me, of a boy or girl chanting forth again and again,<br />
'<span class="smcap">TAKE UP AND READ, TAKE UP AND READ!</span>' Changing<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_81_10" id="PgLn_81_10">{10}</a></span><br />
countenance at these words, I began intently to think<br />
whether boys used them in any game, but could not<br />
recollect that I had ever heard them. I left weeping and<br />
rose up, considering it a divine intimation to open the<br />
Scriptures and read what first presented itself. I had<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_81_15" id="PgLn_81_15">{15}</a></span><br />
heard that Antony had come in during the reading of the<br />
Gospel, and had taken to himself the admonition, 'Go,<br />
sell all that thou hast,' etc., and had turned to Thee at<br />
once, in consequence of that oracle. I had left St.<br />
Paul's volume where Alypius was sitting, when I rose<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_81_20" id="PgLn_81_20">{20}</a></span><br />
thence. I returned thither, seized it, opened, and read<br />
in silence the following passage, which first met my eyes,<br />
'<i>Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and<br />
impurities, not in contention and envy, but put ye on the<br />
Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh in<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_81_25" id="PgLn_81_25">{25}</a></span><br />
its concupiscences</i>.' I had neither desire nor need to<br />
read farther. As I finished the sentence, as though the<br />
light of peace had been poured into my heart, all the<br />
shadows of doubt dispersed. Thus hast Thou converted<br />
me to Thee, so as no longer to seek either for wife or<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_81_30" id="PgLn_81_30">{30}</a></span><br />
other hope of this world, standing fast in that rule of<br />
faith in which Thou so many years before hadst revealed<br />
me to my mother."&mdash;viii. 26-30.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The last words of this extract relate to a dream<br />
which his mother had had some years before,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_81_35" id="PgLn_81_35">{35}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>concerning his conversion. On his first turning<br />
Manichee, abhorring his opinions, she would not<br />
for a while even eat with him, when she had this<br />
dream, in which she had an intimation that where<br />
she stood, there Augustine should one day be<br />
with her. At another time she derived great<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_82_5" id="PgLn_82_5">{5}</a></span><br />
comfort from the casual words of a bishop, who,<br />
when importuned by her to converse with her<br />
son, said at length with some impatience, "Go<br />
thy ways, and God bless thee, for it is not possible<br />
that the son of these tears should perish!" <span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_82_10" id="PgLn_82_10">{10}</a></span><br />
would be out of place, and is perhaps unnecessary,<br />
to enter here into the affecting and well-known<br />
history of her tender anxieties and persevering<br />
prayers for Augustine. Suffice it to say, she saw<br />
the accomplishment of them; she lived till <span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_82_15" id="PgLn_82_15">{15}</a></span><br />
Augustine became a Catholic; and she died in her way<br />
back to Africa with him. Her last words were,<br />
"Lay this body anywhere; let not the care of it<br />
in any way distress you; this only I ask, that<br />
wherever you be, you remember me at the Altar<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_82_20" id="PgLn_82_20">{20}</a></span><br />
of the Lord."<br /></p></blockquote>

her words, "rest in peace with her husband, before and<br />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Introductory</span></p>

<blockquote><p>I confess to a delight in reading the lives, and<br />
dwelling on the characters and actions, of the<br />
Saints of the first ages, such as I receive from none<br />
besides them; and for this reason, because we<br />
know so much more about them than about most<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_84_5" id="PgLn_84_5"></a><a href="#The_personal_touch">{5}</a></span><br />
of the Saints who come after them. People are<br />
variously constituted; what influences one does<br />
not influence another. There are persons of<br />
warm imaginations, who can easily picture to<br />
themselves what they never saw. They can at<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_84_10" id="PgLn_84_10">{10}</a></span><br />
will see Angels and Saints hovering over them<br />
when they are in church; they see their<br />
lineaments, their features, their motions, their<br />
gestures, their smile or their grief. They can go<br />
home and draw what they have seen, from the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_84_15" id="PgLn_84_15">{15}</a></span><br />
vivid memory of what, while it lasted, was so<br />
transporting. I am not one of such; I am touched<br />
by my five senses, by what my eyes behold and<br />
my ears hear. I am touched by what I read<br />
about, not by what I myself create. As faith<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_84_20" id="PgLn_84_20">{20}</a></span><br />
need not lead to practice, so in me mere<br />
imagination does not lead to devotion. I gain more<br />
from the life of our Lord in the Gospels than from<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>a treatise <i>de Deo</i>. I gain more from three verses<br />
of St. John than from the three points of a<br />
meditation. I like a Spanish crucifix of painted wood<br />
more than one from Italy, which is made of gold.<br />
I am more touched by the Seven Dolors than by<br />
the Immaculate Conception; I am more devout<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_85_5" id="PgLn_85_5">{5}</a></span><br />
to St. Gabriel than to one of Isaiah's seraphim.<br />
I love St. Paul more than one of those first<br />
Carmelites, his contemporaries, whose names and acts<br />
no one ever heard of; I feel affectionately towards<br />
the Alexandrian Dionysius, I do homage to St.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_85_10" id="PgLn_85_10">{10}</a></span><br />
George. I do not say that my way is better than<br />
another's; but it is my way, and an allowable<br />
way. And it is the reason why I am so specially<br />
attached to the Saints of the third and fourth<br />
century, because we know so much about them.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_85_15" id="PgLn_85_15">{15}</a></span><br />
This is why I feel a devout affection for St.<br />
Chrysostom. He and the rest of them have<br />
written autobiography on a large scale; they<br />
have given us their own histories, their thoughts,<br />
words, and actions, in a number of goodly folios,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_85_20" id="PgLn_85_20">{20}</a></span><br />
productions which are in themselves some of their<br />
meritorious works....<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The Ancient Saints have left behind them just<br />
that kind of literature which more than any other<br />
represents the abundance of the heart, which<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_85_25" id="PgLn_85_25">{25}</a></span><br />
more than any other approaches to conversation;<br />
I mean correspondence. Why is it that we feel<br />
an interest in Cicero which we cannot feel in<br />
Demosthenes or Plato? Plato is the very type<br />
of soaring philosophy, and Demosthenes of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_85_30" id="PgLn_85_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>forcible eloquence; Cicero is something more than<br />
an orator and a sage; he is not a mere ideality, he<br />
is a man and a brother; he is one of ourselves.<br />
We do not merely believe it, or infer it, but we<br />
have the enduring and living evidence of<br />
it&mdash;how? In his letters. He can be studied,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_86_5" id="PgLn_86_5">{5}</a></span><br />
criticised if you will; but still dwelt upon and<br />
sympathized with also. Now the case of the Ancient<br />
Saints is parallel to that of Cicero. We have their<br />
letters in a marvelous profusion. We have<br />
above 400 letters of St. Basil's; above 200 of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_86_10" id="PgLn_86_10">{10}</a></span><br />
St. Augustine's. St. Chrysostom has left us<br />
about 240; St. Gregory Nazianzen the same<br />
number; Pope St. Gregory as many as 840....<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>A Saint's writings are to me his real "Life";<br />
and what <i>is called</i> his "Life" is not the outline<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_86_15" id="PgLn_86_15">{15}</a></span><br />
of an individual, but either of the <i>auto-saint</i> or<br />
of a myth. Perhaps I shall be asked what I<br />
mean by "Life." I mean a narrative which<br />
impresses the reader with the idea of moral unity,<br />
identity, growth, continuity, personality. When<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_86_20" id="PgLn_86_20">{20}</a></span><br />
a Saint converses with me, I am conscious of the<br />
presence of one active principle of thought, one<br />
individual character, flowing on and into the<br />
various matters which he discusses, and the<br />
different transactions in which he mixes. It is<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_86_25" id="PgLn_86_25">{25}</a></span><br />
what no memorials can reach, however skillfully<br />
elaborated, however free from effort or study,<br />
however conscientiously faithful, however<br />
guaranteed by the veracity of the writers. Why<br />
cannot art rival the lily or the rose? Because the <span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_86_30" id="PgLn_86_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>colors of the flower are developed and blended<br />
by the force of an inward life; while on the other<br />
hand, the lights and shades of the painter are<br />
diligently laid on from without. A magnifying<br />
glass will show the difference. Nor will it<br />
improve matters, though not one only, but a dozen<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_87_5" id="PgLn_87_5">{5}</a></span><br />
good artists successively take part in the picture;<br />
even if the outline is unbroken, the coloring is<br />
muddy. Commonly, what is called "the Life,"<br />
is little more than a collection of anecdotes brought<br />
together from a number of independent quarters;<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_87_10" id="PgLn_87_10">{10}</a></span><br />
anecdotes striking, indeed, and edifying, but<br />
valuable in themselves rather than valuable as parts<br />
of a biography; valuable whoever was the<br />
subject of them, not valuable as illustrating a<br />
particular Saint. It would be difficult to mistake<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_87_15" id="PgLn_87_15">{15}</a></span><br />
for each other a paragraph of St. Ambrose, or of<br />
St. Jerome, or of St. Augustine; it would be very<br />
easy to mistake a chapter in the life of one holy<br />
missionary or nun for a chapter in the life of<br />
another.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_87_20" id="PgLn_87_20">{20}</a></span><br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>An almsgiving here, an instance of meekness<br />
there, a severity of penance, a round of religious<br />
duties,&mdash;all these things humble me, instruct<br />
me, improve me; I cannot desire anything<br />
better of their kind; but they do not necessarily<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_87_25" id="PgLn_87_25">{25}</a></span><br />
coalesce into the image of a person. From such<br />
works I do but learn to pay devotion to an<br />
abstract and typical perfection under a certain<br />
particular name; I do not know more of the real<br />
Saint who bore it than before. Saints, as other<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_87_30" id="PgLn_87_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>men, differ from each other in this, that the<br />
multitude of qualities which they have in<br />
common are differently combined in each of them.<br />
This forms one great part of their personality.<br />
One Saint is remarkable for fortitude; not that<br />
he has not other heroic virtues by <i>concomitance</i>,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_88_5" id="PgLn_88_5">{5}</a></span><br />
as it may be called, but by virtue of that one gift<br />
in particular he has won his crown. Another is<br />
remarkable for patient hope, another for<br />
renunciation of the world. Such a particular virtue<br />
may be said to give form to all the rest which are<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_88_10" id="PgLn_88_10">{10}</a></span><br />
grouped round it, and are molded and modified<br />
by means of it. Thus it is that often what is<br />
right in one would be wrong in another; and, in<br />
fact, the very same action is allowed or chosen<br />
by one, and shunned by another, as being <span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_88_15" id="PgLn_88_15">{15}</a></span><br />
consistent or inconsistent with their respective<br />
characters,&mdash;pretty much as in the combination of<br />
colors, each separate tint takes a shade from<br />
the rest, and is good or bad from its company.<br />
The whole gives a meaning to the parts; but it<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_88_20" id="PgLn_88_20">{20}</a></span><br />
is difficult to rise from the parts to the whole.<br />
When I read St. Augustine or St. Basil, I hold<br />
converse with a beautiful grace-illumined soul,<br />
looking out into this world of sense, and leavening<br />
it with itself; when I read a professed life of him,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_88_25" id="PgLn_88_25">{25}</a></span><br />
I am wandering in a labyrinth of which I cannot<br />
find the center and heart, and am but conducted<br />
out of doors again when I do my best to penetrate<br />
within.<br /></p></blockquote>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>pantheistic treatment of the Saints. I ask something<br />
more than to stumble upon the <i>disjecta<br />
membra</i> of what ought to be a living whole. I<br />
take but a secondary interest in books which<br />
chop up a Saint into chapters of faith, hope,<br />
charity, and the cardinal virtues. They are too<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_89_5" id="PgLn_89_5">{5}</a></span><br />
scientific to be devotional. They have their<br />
great utility, but it is not the utility which they<br />
profess. They do not manifest a Saint, they<br />
mince him into spiritual lessons. They are<br />
rightly called spiritual reading, that is just what<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_89_10" id="PgLn_89_10">{10}</a></span><br />
they are, and they cannot possibly be anything<br />
better; but they are not anything else. They<br />

are put under the patronage and the invocation<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_89_15" id="PgLn_89_15">{15}</a></span><br />
of a Saint. With a view to learning real<br />

any one action or event of his life drawn out<br />
minutely, with his own comments upon it, than<br />
a score of virtues, or of acts of one virtue, strung<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_89_20" id="PgLn_89_20">{20}</a></span><br />
together in as many sentences. Now, in the<br />
ancient writings I have spoken of, certain<br />
transactions are thoroughly worked out. We know all<br />
that happened to a Saint on such or such an<br />
occasion, all that was done by him. We have a view<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_89_25" id="PgLn_89_25">{25}</a></span><br />
of his character, his tastes, his natural infirmities,<br />
his struggles and victories over them, which in<br />
no other way can be attained. And therefore it<br />
is that, without quarreling with the devotion of<br />
others, I give the preference to my own.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_89_30" id="PgLn_89_30">{30}</a></span><br /></p></blockquote>

sixty years of age, when he had to deliver himself<br />

Constantinople for a distant exile. He had been the great<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_90_15" id="PgLn_90_15"></a><a href="#Antipater">{15}</a></span><br />

in her critical condition, the cause of her death.<br />

with the evil work which she had begun. When<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_91_10" id="PgLn_91_10">{10}</a></span><br />
Cucusus would not kill him, they sent him on his<br />

<blockquote><p>A course of ascetic practice such as this would<br />
leave its spiritual effects upon him for life. It<br />
sank deep into him, though the surface might<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_95_10" id="PgLn_95_10">{10}</a></span><br />
not show it. His duty at Constantinople was to<br />
mix with the world; and he lived as others,<br />

office and archiepiscopal station demanded of<br />
him. He wore shoes, and an under garment;<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_95_15" id="PgLn_95_15">{15}</a></span><br />
but his stomach was ever delicate, and at meals<br />
he was obliged to have his own dish, such as it<br />

all ranks of men; and he made friends,<br />
affectionate friends, of young and old, men and women,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_95_20" id="PgLn_95_20">{20}</a></span><br />
rich and poor, by condescending to all of every<br />
degree. How he was loved at Antioch, is shown<br />
by the expedient used to transfer him thence to<br />
Constantinople. Asterius, count of the East, had<br />
orders to send for him, and ask his company to a<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_95_25" id="PgLn_95_25">{25}</a></span><br />
church without the city. Having got him into<br />
his carriage, he drove off with him to the first<br />
station on the highroad to Constantinople, where<br />
imperial officers were in readiness to convey him<br />
thither. Thus he was brought upon the scene of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_95_30" id="PgLn_95_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>those trials which have given him a name in history,<br />

not as popular, as at Antioch. "The people<br />
flocked to him," says Sozomen, "as often as he<br />
preached; some of them to hear what would<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_96_5" id="PgLn_96_5">{5}</a></span><br />
profit them, others to make trial of him. He<br />
carried them away, one and all, and persuaded<br />

enough of them; so that, when they thrust and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_96_10" id="PgLn_96_10">{10}</a></span><br />
jammed themselves together in an alarming way,<br />
every one making an effort to get nearer to him,<br />

<blockquote><p>Here he differs, as far as I can judge, from his<br />
brother saints and doctors of the Greek Church,<br />
St. Basil and St. Gregory Nazianzen. They were<br />
scholars, shy perhaps and reserved; and though<br />
they had not given up the secular state, they were<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_96_25" id="PgLn_96_25">{25}</a></span><br />
essentially monks. There is no evidence, that I<br />
remember, to show that they attached men to<br />
their persons. They, as well as John, had a<br />
multitude of enemies; and were regarded, the<br />
one with dislike, the other perhaps with contempt;<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_96_30" id="PgLn_96_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>but they had not, on the other hand,<br />
warm, eager, sympathetic, indignant, agonized<br />
friends. There is another characteristic in<br />
Chrysostom, which perhaps gained for him this great<br />
blessing. He had, as it would seem, a vigor,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_97_5" id="PgLn_97_5">{5}</a></span><br />
elasticity, and, what may be called, sunniness of<br />
mind, all his own. He was ever sanguine,<br />
seldom sad. Basil had a life-long malady, involving<br />
continual gnawing pain and a weight of physical<br />
dejection. He bore his burden well and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_97_10" id="PgLn_97_10"></a><a href="#The_seasons">{10}</a></span><br />
gracefully, like the great Saint he was, as Job bore his;<br />
but it was a burden like Job's. He was a calm, mild,<br />
grave, autumnal day; St. John Chrysostom was<br />
a day in spring-time, bright and rainy, and<br />
glittering through its rain. Gregory was the full<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_97_15" id="PgLn_97_15">{15}</a></span><br />
summer, with a long spell of pleasant stillness, its<br />
monotony relieved by thunder and lightning.<br />
And St. Athanasius figures to us the stern<br />
persecuting winter, with its wild winds, its dreary<br />
wastes, its sleep of the great mother, and the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_97_20" id="PgLn_97_20">{20}</a></span><br />
bright stars shining overhead. He and<br />
Chrysostom have no points in common; but Gregory was<br />
a dethroned Archbishop of Constantinople, like<br />
Chrysostom, and, again, dethroned by his<br />
brethren the Bishops. Like Basil, too, Chrysostom was<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_97_25" id="PgLn_97_25">{25}</a></span><br />
bowed with infirmities of body; he was often ill;<br />
he was thin and wizened; cold was a misery to<br />
him; heat affected his head; he scarcely dare<br />
touch wine; he was obliged to use the bath;<br />
obliged to take exercise, or rather to be<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_97_30" id="PgLn_97_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>continually on the move. Whether from a nervous or<br />
febrile complexion, he was warm in temper; or<br />
at least, at certain times, his emotion struggled<br />
hard with his reason. But he had that noble<br />
spirit which complains as little as possible; which<br />
makes the best of things; which soon recovers<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_98_5" id="PgLn_98_5">{5}</a></span><br />
its equanimity, and hopes on in circumstances<br />
when others sink down in despair....<br /></p></blockquote>

heathenism. Again, he is not an Augustine,<br />

and laying, in successive controversies, the<br />
foundations of theology. Nor is he a Jerome, so dead to<br />

scandal to his brethren. He has not trampled upon<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_99_10" id="PgLn_99_10">{10}</a></span><br />
heresy, nor smitten emperors, nor beautified the<br />
house or the service of God, nor knit together the<br />

not that any Saint&mdash;could possibly contrive to<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_100_15" id="PgLn_100_15">{15}</a></span><br />
abstract the love of the work from the love of<br />
its Maker, or could feel a tenderness for earth<br />
which did not spring from devotion to heaven;<br />
or as if he would not love everything just in that<br />
degree in which the Creator loves it, and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_100_20" id="PgLn_100_20">{20}</a></span><br />
according to the measure of gifts which the Creator<br />
has bestowed upon it, and pre&euml;minently for the<br />
Creator's sake. But this is the characteristic<br />
of all Saints; and I am speaking, not of what St.<br />
Chrysostom had in common with others, but what<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_100_25" id="PgLn_100_25">{25}</a></span><br />
he had special to himself; and this specialty, I<br />
conceive, is the interest which he takes in all<br />
things, not so far as God has made them alike,<br />
but as He has made them different from each<br />
other. I speak of the discriminating<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_100_30" id="PgLn_100_30"></a><a href="#Chrysostoms_discriminating_affectionateness">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>affectionateness with which he accepts every one for what is<br />
personal in him and unlike others. I speak of his<br />
versatile recognition of men, one by one, for the<br />
sake of that portion of good, be it more or less,<br />
of a lower order or a higher, which has severally<br />
been lodged in them; his eager contemplation of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_101_5" id="PgLn_101_5">{5}</a></span><br />
the many things they do, effect, or produce, of<br />
all their great works, as nations or as states;<br />
nay, even as they are corrupted or disguised by<br />
evil, so far as that evil may in imagination be<br />
disjoined from their proper nature, or may be<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_101_10" id="PgLn_101_10">{10}</a></span><br />
regarded as a mere material disorder apart from<br />
its formal character of guilt. I speak of the<br />
kindly spirit and the genial temper with which<br />
he looks round at all things which this<br />
wonderful world contains; of the graphic fidelity with<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_101_15" id="PgLn_101_15">{15}</a></span><br />
which he notes them down upon the tablets of<br />
his mind, and of the promptitude and propriety<br />
with which he calls them up as arguments or<br />
illustrations in the course of his teaching as the<br />
occasion requires. Possessed though he be by<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_101_20" id="PgLn_101_20">{20}</a></span><br />
the fire of Divine charity, he has not lost one<br />
fiber, he does not miss one vibration, of the<br />
complicated whole of human sentiment and affection;<br />
like the miraculous bush in the desert, which, for<br />
all the flame that wrapt it round, was not thereby<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_101_25" id="PgLn_101_25">{25}</a></span><br />
consumed.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Such, in a transcendent perfection, was the<br />
gaze, as we may reverently suppose, with which<br />
the loving Father of all surveyed in eternity that<br />
universe even in its minutest details which He<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_101_30" id="PgLn_101_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>had decreed to create such the loving pity with<br />
which He spoke the word when the due moment<br />
came, and began to mold the finite, as He<br />
created it, in His infinite hands; such the watchful<br />
solicitude with which he now keeps His<br />
catalogue of the innumerable birds of heaven, and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_102_5" id="PgLn_102_5">{5}</a></span><br />
counts day by day the very hairs of our head and<br />
the alternations of our breathing. Such, much<br />
more, is the awful contemplation with which He<br />
encompasses incessantly every one of those souls<br />
on whom He heaps His mercies here, in order<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_102_10" id="PgLn_102_10">{10}</a></span><br />
to make them the intimate associates of His own<br />
eternity hereafter. And we too, in our measure,<br />
are bound to imitate Him in our exact and vivid<br />
apprehension of Himself and of His works. As to<br />
Himself, we love Him, not simply in His nature,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_102_15" id="PgLn_102_15">{15}</a></span><br />
but in His triple personality, lest we become mere<br />
pantheists. And so, again, we choose our patron<br />
Saints, not for what they have in common with<br />
each other (else there could be no room for choice<br />
at all), but for what is peculiar to them severally.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_102_20" id="PgLn_102_20">{20}</a></span><br />
That which is my warrant, therefore, for particular<br />
devotions at all, becomes itself my reason for<br />
devotion to St. John Chrysostom. In him I<br />
recognize a special pattern of that very gift of<br />
discrimination. He may indeed be said in some sense to<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_102_25" id="PgLn_102_25">{25}</a></span><br />
have a devotion of his own for every one who<br />
comes across him,&mdash;for persons, ranks, classes,<br />
callings, societies, considered as Divine works and<br />
the subjects of his good offices or good will, and<br />
therefore I have a devotion for him.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_102_30" id="PgLn_102_30">{30}</a></span><br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>It is this observant benevolence which gives to<br />
his exposition of Scripture its chief characteristic.<br />
He is known in ecclesiastical literature as the<br />
expounder, above all others, of its literal sense.<br />
Now in mystical comments the direct object which<br />
the writer sets before him is the Divine Author<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_103_5" id="PgLn_103_5">{5}</a></span><br />
Himself of the written Word. Such a writer<br />
sees in Scripture, not so much the works of God,<br />
as His nature and attributes; the Teacher more<br />
than the definite teaching, or its human<br />
instruments, with their drifts and motives, their courses<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_103_10" id="PgLn_103_10">{10}</a></span><br />
of thought, their circumstances and personal<br />
peculiarities. He loses the creature in the glory<br />
which surrounds the Creator. The problem<br />
before him is not what the inspired writer directly<br />
meant, and why, but, out of the myriad of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_103_15" id="PgLn_103_15">{15}</a></span><br />
meanings present to the Infinite Being who inspired him,<br />
which it is that is most illustrative of that Great<br />
Being's all-holy attributes and solemn dispositions.<br />
Thus, in the Psalter, he will drop David and Israel<br />
and the Temple together, and will recognize <span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_103_20" id="PgLn_103_20">{20}</a></span><br />
nothing there but the shadows of those greater truths<br />
which remain forever. Accordingly, the<br />
mystical comment will be of an objective character;<br />
whereas a writer who delights to ponder human<br />
nature and human affairs, to analyze the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_103_25" id="PgLn_103_25">{25}</a></span><br />
workings of the mind, and to contemplate what is<br />
subjective to it, is naturally drawn to investigate<br />
the sense of the sacred writer himself, who was the<br />
organ of the revelation, that is, he will investigate<br />
the literal sense. Now, in the instance of St. <span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_103_30" id="PgLn_103_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>Chrysostom, it so happens that literal exposition<br />
is the historical characteristic of the school in<br />
which he was brought up; so that if he commented<br />
on Scripture at all, he anyhow would have<br />
adopted that method; still, there have been<br />
many literal expositors, but only one<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_104_5" id="PgLn_104_5">{5}</a></span><br />
Chrysostom. It is St. Chrysostom who is the charm of<br />
the method, not the method that is the charm<br />
of St. Chrysostom.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>That charm lies, as I have said, in his habit and<br />
his power of throwing himself into the minds<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_104_10" id="PgLn_104_10">{10}</a></span><br />
of others, of imagining with exactness and with<br />
sympathy circumstances or scenes which were<br />
not before him, and of bringing out what he has<br />
apprehended in words as direct and vivid as the<br />
apprehension. His page is like the table of a<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_104_15" id="PgLn_104_15">{15}</a></span><br />
<i>camera lucida</i>, which represents to us the living<br />
action and interaction of all that goes on around<br />
us. That loving scrutiny, with which he follows<br />
the Apostles as they reveal themselves to us in<br />
their writings, he practices in various ways<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_104_20" id="PgLn_104_20">{20}</a></span><br />
towards all men, living and dead, high and low,<br />
those whom he admires and those whom he weeps<br />
over. He writes as one who was ever looking<br />
out with sharp but kind eyes upon the world of<br />
men and their history; and hence he has always<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_104_25" id="PgLn_104_25">{25}</a></span><br />
something to produce about them, new or old,<br />
to the purpose of his argument, whether from<br />
books or from the experience of life. Head and<br />
heart were full to overflowing with a stream of<br />
mingled "wine and milk," of rich vigorous thought<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_104_30" id="PgLn_104_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>and affectionate feeling. This is why his manner<br />

they might have swept over the face of the earth,<br />
and scourged the human race, powerful to destroy,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_111_15" id="PgLn_111_15">{15}</a></span><br />
helpless to construct, and in consequence<br />
ephemeral; but this would have been all. But this has<br />
not been all, as regards the Turks; for, in spite<br />
of their intimate resemblance or relationship to<br />
the Tartar tribes, in spite of their essential<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_111_20" id="PgLn_111_20">{20}</a></span><br />
barbarism to this day, still they, or at least great<br />
portions of the race, have been put under<br />
education; they have been submitted to a slow<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>course of change, with a long history and a profitable<br />
discipline and fortunes of a peculiar kind;<br />
and thus they have gained those qualities of<br />
mind, which alone enable a nation to wield and<br />
to consolidate imperial power.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>I have said that, when first they distinctly<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_112_5" id="PgLn_112_5">{5}</a></span><br />
appear on the scene of history, they are<br />
indistinguishable from Tartars. Mount Altai, the<br />
high metropolis of Tartary, is surrounded by a<br />
hilly district, rich not only in the useful, but in<br />
the precious metals. Gold is said to abound<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_112_10" id="PgLn_112_10">{10}</a></span><br />
there; but it is still more fertile in veins of iron,<br />
which indeed is said to be the most plentiful in<br />
the world. There have been iron works there<br />
from time immemorial, and at the time that the<br />
Huns descended on the Roman Empire (in the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_112_15" id="PgLn_112_15">{15}</a></span><br />
fifth century of the Christian era), we find<br />
the Turks nothing more than a family of slaves,<br />
employed as workers of the ore and as blacksmiths<br />
by the dominant tribe. Suddenly in the course<br />
of fifty years, soon after the fall of the Hunnish<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_112_20" id="PgLn_112_20">{20}</a></span><br />
power in Europe, with the sudden development<br />
peculiar to Tartars, we find these Turks spread<br />
from East to West, and lords of a territory so<br />
extensive, that they were connected, by relations<br />
of peace or war, at once with the Chinese, the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_112_25" id="PgLn_112_25">{25}</a></span><br />
Persians, and the Romans. They had reached<br />
Kamtchatka on the North, the Caspian on the<br />
West, and perhaps even the mouth of the Indus<br />
on the South. Here then we have an<br />
intermediate empire of Tartars, placed between the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_112_30" id="PgLn_112_30"></a><a href="#Attila">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>eras of Attila and Zingis; but in this sketch it has<br />
no place, except as belonging to Turkish history,<br />
because it was contained within the limits of<br />
Asia, and, though it lasted for 200 years, it only<br />
faintly affected the political transactions of<br />
Europe. However, it was not without some sort<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_113_5" id="PgLn_113_5">{5}</a></span><br />
of influence on Christendom, for the Romans<br />
interchanged embassies with its sovereign in the<br />
reign of the then Greek Emperor Justin the<br />
younger (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 570), with the view of engaging<br />
him in a warlike alliance against Persia. The<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_113_10" id="PgLn_113_10">{10}</a></span><br />
account of one of these embassies remains, and<br />
the picture it presents of the Turks is important,<br />
because it seems clearly to identify them with<br />
the Tartar race.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>For instance, in the mission to the Tartars<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_113_15" id="PgLn_113_15">{15}</a></span><br />
from the Pope, which I have already spoken of,<br />
the friars were led between two fires, when they<br />
approached the Khan, and they at first refused<br />
to follow, thinking they might be countenancing<br />
some magical rite. Now we find it recorded of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_113_20" id="PgLn_113_20">{20}</a></span><br />
this Roman embassy, that, on its arrival, it was<br />
purified by the Turks with fire and incense. As<br />
to incense, which seems out of place among such<br />
barbarians, it is remarkable that it is used in<br />
the ceremonial of the Turkish court to this day.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_113_25" id="PgLn_113_25">{25}</a></span><br />
At least Sir Charles Fellows, in his work on the<br />
Antiquities of Asia Minor, in 1838, speaks of the<br />
Sultan as going to the festival of Bairam with<br />
incense-bearers before him. Again, when the<br />
Romans were presented to the great Khan, they<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_113_30" id="PgLn_113_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>found him in his tent, seated on a throne, to which<br />
wheels were attached and horses attachable, in<br />
other words, a Tartar wagon. Moreover, they<br />
were entertained at a banquet which lasted the<br />
greater part of the day; and an intoxicating<br />
liquor, not wine, which was sweet and pleasant,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_114_5" id="PgLn_114_5">{5}</a></span><br />
was freely presented to them; evidently the<br />
Tartar <i>koumiss</i>.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The next day they had a<br />
second entertainment in a still more splendid<br />
tent; the hangings were of embroidered silk, and<br />
the throne, the cups, and the vases were of gold.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_114_10" id="PgLn_114_10">{10}</a></span><br />
On the third day, the pavilion, in which they were<br />
received, was supported on gilt columns; a couch<br />
of massive gold was raised on four gold peacocks;<br />
and before the entrance to the tent was what<br />
might be called a sideboard, only that it was a<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_114_15" id="PgLn_114_15">{15}</a></span><br />
sort of barricade of wagons, laden with dishes,<br />
basins, and statues of solid silver. All these<br />
points in the description&mdash;the silk hangings, the<br />
gold vessels, the successively increasing splendor<br />
of the entertainments&mdash;remind us of the courts<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_114_20" id="PgLn_114_20"></a><a href="#Timour">{20}</a></span><br />
of Zingis and Timour, 700 and 900 years<br />
afterwards.<br /></p></blockquote>

which is their historical badge. And it was their<br />

it did in its day, as (unless it be a paradox to<br />

happens, that those Turkish tribes which have<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_114_30" id="PgLn_114_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>changed their original character and have a place<br />
in the history of the world, have obtained their<br />

very different from that which took place in the<br />
nations most familiar to us. What this process<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_115_5" id="PgLn_115_5">{5}</a></span><br />
has been I will say presently; first, however, let<br />
us observe that, fortunately for our purpose, we<br />
have still specimens existing of those other<br />
Turkish tribes, which were never submitted to<br />
this process of education and change, and, in<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_115_10" id="PgLn_115_10">{10}</a></span><br />
looking at them as they now exist, we see at this<br />
very day the Turkish nationality in something<br />
very like its original form, and are able to decide<br />
for ourselves on its close approximation to the<br />
Tartar. You may recollect I pointed out to<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_115_15" id="PgLn_115_15">{15}</a></span><br />
you, Gentlemen, in the opening of these lectures,<br />
the course which the pastoral tribes, or nomads<br />
as they are often called, must necessarily take<br />
in their emigrations. They were forced along<br />
in one direction till they emerged from their<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_115_20" id="PgLn_115_20">{20}</a></span><br />
mountain valleys, and descended their high<br />
plateau at the end of Tartary, and then they had<br />
the opportunity of turning south. If they did<br />
not avail themselves of this opening, but went on<br />
still westward, their next southern pass would<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_115_25" id="PgLn_115_25">{25}</a></span><br />
be the defiles of the Caucasus and Circassia, to<br />
the west of the Caspian. If they did not use this,<br />
they would skirt the top of the Black Sea, and<br />
so reach Europe. Thus in the emigration of the<br />
Huns from China, you may recollect a tribe of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_115_30" id="PgLn_115_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>them turned to the South as soon as they could,<br />
and settled themselves between the high Tartar<br />
land and the sea of Aral, while the main body<br />
went on to the furthest West by the north of the<br />
Black Sea. Now with this last passage into<br />
Europe we are not here concerned, for the Turks<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_116_5" id="PgLn_116_5">{5}</a></span><br />
have never introduced themselves to Europe by<br />
means of it;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> but with those two southward<br />
passages which are Asiatic, viz., that to the east<br />
of the Aral, and that to the west of the Caspian.<br />
The Turkish tribes have all descended upon the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_116_10" id="PgLn_116_10">{10}</a></span><br />
civilized world by one or other of these two roads;<br />
and I observe, that those which have descended<br />
along the east of the Aral have changed their<br />
social habits and gained political power, while<br />
those which descended to the west of the Caspian<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_116_15" id="PgLn_116_15">{15}</a></span><br />
remain pretty much what they ever were. The<br />
former of these go among us by the general<br />
name of Turks; the latter are the Turcomans<br />
or Turkmans.... At the very date at which<br />
Heraclius called the Turcomans into Georgia, at<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_116_20" id="PgLn_116_20"></a><a href="#Heraclius">{20}</a></span><br />
the very date when their Eastern brethren<br />
crossed the northern border of Sogdiana, an event<br />
of most momentous import had occurred in the<br />
South. A new religion had arisen in Arabia.<br />
The impostor Mahomet, announcing himself the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_116_25" id="PgLn_116_25"></a><a href="#That_book">{25}</a></span><br />
Prophet of God, was writing the pages of that<br />
book, and molding the faith of that people, which<br />
was to subdue half the known world. The Turks<br />
passed the Jaxartes southward in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 626; just<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>four years before Mahomet had assumed the royal<br />
dignity, and just six years after, on his death,<br />
his followers began the conquest of the Persian<br />
Empire. In the course of 20 years they effected<br />
it; Sogdiana was at its very extremity, or its<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_117_5" id="PgLn_117_5">{5}</a></span><br />
borderland; there the last king of Persia took<br />
refuge from the south, while the Turks were<br />
pouring into it from the north. There was little to<br />
choose for the unfortunate prince between the<br />
Turk and the Saracen; the Turks were his<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_117_10" id="PgLn_117_10">{10}</a></span><br />
hereditary foe; they had been the giants and<br />
monsters of the popular poetry; but he threw<br />
himself into their arms. They engaged in his<br />
service, betrayed him, murdered him, and<br />
measured themselves with the Saracens in his stead.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_117_15" id="PgLn_117_15">{15}</a></span><br />
Thus the military strength of the north and south<br />
of Asia, the Saracenic and the Turkish, came into<br />
memorable conflict in the regions of which I have<br />
said so much. The struggle was a fierce one, and<br />
lasted many years; the Turks striving to force<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_117_20" id="PgLn_117_20">{20}</a></span><br />
their way down to the ocean, the Saracens to<br />
drive them back into their Scythian deserts.<br />
They first fought this issue in Bactriana or<br />
Khorasan; the Turks got the worst of the fight,<br />
and then it was thrown back upon Sogdiana<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_117_25" id="PgLn_117_25">{25}</a></span><br />
itself, and there it ended again in favor of the<br />
Saracens. At the end of 90 years from the time<br />
of the first Turkish descent on this fair region,<br />
they relinquished it to their Mahometan<br />
opponents. The conquerors found it rich, populous,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_117_30" id="PgLn_117_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>and powerful; its cities, Carisme, Bokhara, and<br />
Samarcand, were surrounded beyond their<br />
fortifications by a suburb of fields and gardens, which<br />
was in turn protected by exterior works; its plains<br />
were well cultivated, and its commerce extended<br />
from China to Europe. Its riches were<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_118_5" id="PgLn_118_5">{5}</a></span><br />
proportionally great; the Saracens were able to extort<br />
a tribute of two million gold pieces from the<br />
inhabitants; we read, moreover, of the crown<br />
jewels of one of the Turkish princesses; and of<br />
the buskin of another, which she dropt in her<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_118_10" id="PgLn_118_10">{10}</a></span><br />
flight from Bokhara, as being worth two<br />
thousand pieces of gold.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Such had been the prosperity<br />
of the barbarian invaders, such was its end; but<br />

<blockquote><p>It is usual for historians to say, that the<br />
triumph of the South threw the Turks back again<br />
upon their northern solitudes; and this might<br />
easily be the case with some of the many hordes,<br />
which were ever passing the boundary and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_118_20" id="PgLn_118_20">{20}</a></span><br />
flocking down; but it is no just account of the<br />

instance, of this day are substantially what they<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_118_25" id="PgLn_118_25">{25}</a></span><br />
were four centuries ago. We cannot conceive,<br />

whether from skill in the Saracens, or from <span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_119_5" id="PgLn_119_5">{5}</a></span><br />
far-reaching sagacity in the Turks (and it is difficult<br />
to assign it to either cause), so it was, that a<br />
process of this nature followed close upon the<br />
Mahometan conquest of Sogdiana. It is to be<br />
traced in detail to a variety of accidents. Many<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_119_10" id="PgLn_119_10">{10}</a></span><br />
of the Turks probably were made slaves, and the<br />
service to which they were subjected was no<br />
matter of choice. Numbers had got attached to<br />
the soil; and inheriting the blood of Persians,<br />
White Huns, or aboriginal inhabitants for three<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_119_15" id="PgLn_119_15">{15}</a></span><br />
generations, had simply unlearned the wildness<br />
of the Tartar shepherd. Others fell victims to<br />
the religion of their conquerors, which ultimately,<br />
as we know, exercised a most remarkable<br />
influence upon them. Not all at once, but as<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_119_20" id="PgLn_119_20">{20}</a></span><br />
tribe descended after tribe, and generation<br />
followed generation, they succumbed to the creed<br />
of Mahomet; and they embraced it with the<br />
ardor and enthusiasm which Franks and Saxons<br />
so gloriously and meritoriously manifested in their<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_119_25" id="PgLn_119_25">{25}</a></span><br />
conversion to Christianity.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Here again was a very powerful instrument<br />
in modification of their national character. Let<br />
me illustrate it in one particular. If there is one<br />
peculiarity above another, proper to the savage<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_119_30" id="PgLn_119_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>and to the Tartar, it is that of excitability and<br />
impetuosity on ordinary occasions; the Turks,<br />
on the other hand, are nationally remarkable for<br />
gravity and almost apathy of demeanor. Now<br />
there are evidently elements in the Mahometan<br />
creed, which would tend to change them from<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_120_5" id="PgLn_120_5">{5}</a></span><br />
the one temperament to the other. Its<br />
sternness, its coldness, its doctrine of fatalism; even<br />
the truths which it borrowed from Revelation,<br />
when separated from the truths it rejected, its<br />
monotheism untempered by mediation, its severe<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_120_10" id="PgLn_120_10"></a><a href="#Monotheism">{10}</a></span><br />
view of the Divine attributes, of the law, and of a<br />
sure retribution to come, wrought both a gloom<br />
and also an improvement in the barbarian, not<br />
very unlike the effect which some forms of<br />
Protestantism produce among ourselves. But<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_120_15" id="PgLn_120_15">{15}</a></span><br />
whatever was the mode of operation, certainly<br />
it is to their religion that this peculiarity of the<br />
Turks is ascribed by competent judges.<br />
Lieutenant Wood in his journal gives us a lively<br />
account of a peculiarity of theirs, which he<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_120_20" id="PgLn_120_20">{20}</a></span><br />
unhesitatingly attributes to Islamism. "Nowhere,"<br />
he says, "is the difference between European and<br />
Mahometan society more strongly marked than<br />
in the lower walks of life.... A Kasid, or<br />
messenger, for example, will come into a public<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_120_25" id="PgLn_120_25"></a><a href="#Durbar">{25}</a></span><br />
department, deliver his letters in full durbar, and<br />
demean himself throughout the interview with<br />
so much composure and self-possession, that an<br />
European can hardly believe that his grade in<br />
society is so low. After he has delivered his<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_120_30" id="PgLn_120_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>letters, he takes his seat among the crowd, and<br />
answers, calmly and without hesitation, all the<br />
questions which may be addressed to him, or<br />
communicates the verbal instructions with which<br />
he has been intrusted by his employer, and<br />
which are often of more importance than the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_121_5" id="PgLn_121_5">{5}</a></span><br />
letters themselves. Indeed, all the inferior classes<br />
possess an innate self-respect, and a natural<br />
gravity of deportment, which differs as far from<br />
the suppleness of a Hindustani as from the<br />
awkward rusticity of an English clown." ... "Even<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_121_10" id="PgLn_121_10">{10}</a></span><br />
children," he continues, "in Mahometan countries<br />
have an unusual degree of gravity in their<br />
deportment. The boy, who can but lisp his 'Peace be<br />
with you,' has imbibed this portion of the national<br />
character. In passing through a village, these<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_121_15" id="PgLn_121_15">{15}</a></span><br />
little men will place their hands upon their<br />
breasts, and give the usual greeting. Frequently<br />
have I seen the children of chiefs approach their<br />
father's durbar, and stopping short at the<br />
threshold of the door, utter the shout of 'Salam<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_121_20" id="PgLn_121_20">{20}</a></span><br />
Ali-Kum,' so as to draw all eyes upon them; but<br />
nothing daunted, they marched boldly into the<br />
room, and sliding down upon their knees, folded<br />
their arms and took their seat upon the musnad<br />
with all the gravity of grown-up persons." <span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_121_25" id="PgLn_121_25">{25}</a></span><br /></p></blockquote>

Turks, so doubtless it has in other ways materially<br />

well-wooded mountains and sunny slopes of Asia<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_122_15" id="PgLn_122_15"></a><a href="#Eastern_Mahometans">{15}</a></span><br />
Minor. The Turcomans were brought out of<br />
their dreary deserts, yet they retained their old<br />
habits, and they remain barbarians to this day.<br />
But why? it must be borne in mind, they neither<br />
subjugated the inhabitants of their new country<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_122_20" id="PgLn_122_20"></a><a href="#Sogdiana">{20}</a></span><br />
on the one hand, nor were subjugated by them<br />
on the other. They never had direct or intimate<br />
relations with it; they were brought into it by<br />
the Roman Government at Constantinople as its<br />
auxiliaries, but they never naturalized themselves<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_122_25" id="PgLn_122_25">{25}</a></span><br />
there. They were like gypsies in England, except<br />
that they were mounted freebooters instead of<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>pilferers and fortune tellers. It was far otherwise<br />
with their brethren in Sogdiana; they were<br />
there first as conquerors, then as conquered.<br />
First they held it in possession as their prize for<br />
90 or 100 years; they came into the usufruct and<br />
enjoyment of it. Next, their political ascendancy<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_123_5" id="PgLn_123_5"></a><a href="#White_Huns">{5}</a></span><br />
over it involved, as in the case of the White Huns,<br />
some sort of moral surrender of themselves to it.<br />
What was the first consequence of this? that,<br />
like the White Huns, they intermarried with the<br />
races they found there. We know the custom<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_123_10" id="PgLn_123_10">{10}</a></span><br />
of the Tartars and Turks; under such<br />
circumstances they would avail themselves of their<br />
national practice of polygamy to its full extent<br />
of license. In the course of twenty years a new<br />
generation would arise of a mixed race; and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_123_15" id="PgLn_123_15">{15}</a></span><br />
these in turn would marry into the native<br />
population, and at the end of ninety or a hundred<br />
years we should find the great-grandsons or the<br />
great-great-grandsons of the wild marauders who<br />
first crossed the Jaxartes, so different from their<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_123_20" id="PgLn_123_20">{20}</a></span><br />
ancestors in features both of mind and body,<br />
that they hardly would be recognized as deserving<br />
the Tartar name. At the end of that period their<br />
power came to an end, the Saracens became<br />
masters of them and of their country, but the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_123_25" id="PgLn_123_25">{25}</a></span><br />
process of emigration southward from the<br />
Scythian desert, which had never intermitted during<br />
the years of their domination, continued still,<br />
though that domination was no more.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Here it is necessary to have a clear idea of the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_123_30" id="PgLn_123_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>nature of that association of the Turkish tribes<br />
from the Volga to the Eastern Sea, to which I<br />
have given the name of Empire: it was not so<br />
much of a political as of a national character;<br />
it was the power, not of a system, but of a race.<br />
They were not one well-organized state, but a<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_124_5" id="PgLn_124_5">{5}</a></span><br />
number of independent tribes, acting generally<br />
together, acknowledging one leader or not,<br />
according to circumstances, combining and<br />
co&ouml;perating from the identity of object which acted<br />
on them, and often jealous of each other and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_124_10" id="PgLn_124_10">{10}</a></span><br />
quarreling with each other on account of that<br />
very identity. Each tribe made its way down to<br />
the south as it could; one blocked up the way of<br />
the other for a time; there were stoppages and<br />
collisions, but there was a continual movement<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_124_15" id="PgLn_124_15">{15}</a></span><br />
and progress. Down they came one after another,<br />
like wolves after their prey; and as the tribes<br />
which came first became partially civilized, and<br />
as a mixed generation arose, these would naturally<br />
be desirous of keeping back their less polished<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_124_20" id="PgLn_124_20">{20}</a></span><br />
uncles or cousins, if they could; and would do so<br />
successfully for a while: but cupidity is stronger<br />
than conservatism; and so, in spite of delay and<br />
difficulty, down they would keep coming, and<br />
down they did come, even after and in spite of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_124_25" id="PgLn_124_25">{25}</a></span><br />
the overthrow of their Empire; crowding down<br />
as to a new world, to get what they could, as<br />
adventurers, ready to turn to the right or the<br />
left, prepared to struggle on anyhow, willing to<br />
be forced forward into countries farther still,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_124_30" id="PgLn_124_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>careless what might turn up, so that they did but<br />
get down. And this was the process which went<br />
on (whatever were their fortunes when they<br />
actually got down, prosperous or adverse) for<br />
400, nay, I will say for 700 years. The<br />
storehouse of the north was never exhausted; it<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_125_5" id="PgLn_125_5">{5}</a></span><br />
sustained the never ending run upon its resources.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>I was just now referring to a change in the<br />

which had as important a bearing as any other<br />
of their changes upon their subsequent fortunes.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_125_10" id="PgLn_125_10">{10}</a></span><br />
It was a change in their physiognomy and shape,<br />
so striking as to recommend them to their<br />
masters for the purposes of war or of display.<br />
Instead of bearing any longer the hideous exterior<br />
which in the Huns frightened the Romans and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_125_15" id="PgLn_125_15">{15}</a></span><br />
Goths, they were remarkable, even as early as the<br />
ninth century, when they had been among the<br />
natives of Sogdiana only two hundred years,<br />
for the beauty of their persons. An important<br />
political event was the result: hence the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_125_20" id="PgLn_125_20">{20}</a></span><br />
introduction of the Turks into the heart of the<br />
Saracenic empire. By this time the Caliphs had<br />
removed from Damascus to Bagdad; Persia was<br />
the imperial province, and into Persia they were<br />
introduced for the reason I have mentioned,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_125_25" id="PgLn_125_25"></a><a href="#Damascus">{25}</a></span><br />
sometimes as slaves, sometimes as captives taken<br />
in war, sometimes as mercenaries for the<br />
Saracenic armies: at length they were enrolled as<br />
guards to the Caliph, and even appointed to<br />
offices in the palace, to the command of the forces,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_125_30" id="PgLn_125_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>and to governorships in the provinces. The son<br />
of the celebrated Harun al Raschid had as many<br />
as 50,000 of these troops in Bagdad itself. And<br />
thus slowly and silently they made their way to<br />
the south, not with the pomp and pretense of<br />
conquest, but by means of that ordinary<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_126_5" id="PgLn_126_5"></a><a href="#Harun_al_Raschid">{5}</a></span><br />
inter-communion which connected one portion of the<br />
empire of the Caliphs with another. In this<br />
manner they were introduced even into Egypt.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>This was their history for a hundred and fifty<br />
years, and what do we suppose would be the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_126_10" id="PgLn_126_10">{10}</a></span><br />
result of this importation of barbarians into the<br />
heart of a nourishing empire? Would they be<br />
absorbed as slaves or settlers in the mass of the<br />
population, or would they, like mercenaries<br />
elsewhere, be fatal to the power that introduced<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_126_15" id="PgLn_126_15">{15}</a></span><br />
them? The answer is not difficult, considering<br />
that their very introduction argued a want of<br />
energy and resource in the rulers whom they<br />
served. To employ them was a confession of<br />
weakness; the Saracenic power indeed was not<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_126_20" id="PgLn_126_20">{20}</a></span><br />
very aged, but the Turkish was much younger,<br />
and more vigorous; then too must be<br />
considered the difference of national character<br />
between the Turks and the Saracens. A writer of<br />
the beginning of the present century<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_35">[35]</a> compares<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_126_25" id="PgLn_126_25">{25}</a></span><br />
the Turks to the Romans; such parallels are<br />
generally fanciful and fallacious; but, if we must<br />
accept it in the present instance, we may<br />
complete the picture by likening the Saracens and<br />
Persians to the Greeks, and we know what was<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_126_30" id="PgLn_126_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>the result of the collision between Greece and<br />
Rome. The Persians were poets, the Saracens<br />
were philosophers. The mathematics, astronomy,<br />
and botany were especial subjects of the studies of<br />
the latter. Their observatories were celebrated,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_127_5" id="PgLn_127_5">{5}</a></span><br />
and they may be considered to have originated<br />
the science of chemistry. The Turks, on the<br />
other hand, though they are said to have a<br />
literature, and though certain of their princes have<br />
been patrons of letters, have never distinguished<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_127_10" id="PgLn_127_10">{10}</a></span><br />
themselves in exercises of pure intellect; but<br />
they have had an energy of character, a<br />
pertinacity, a perseverance, and a political talent, in<br />
a word, they then had the qualities of mind<br />
necessary for ruling, in far greater measure, than<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_127_15" id="PgLn_127_15">{15}</a></span><br />
the people they were serving. The Saracens,<br />
like the Greeks, carried their arms over the<br />
surface of the earth with an unrivaled brilliancy<br />
and an uncheckered success; but their dominion,<br />
like that of Greece, did not last for more than<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_127_20" id="PgLn_127_20">{20}</a></span><br />
200 or 300 years. Rome grew slowly through<br />
many centuries, and its influence lasts to this<br />
day; the Turkish race battled with difficulties<br />
and reverses, and made its way on amid tumult<br />
and complication, for a good 1000 years from<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_127_25" id="PgLn_127_25"></a><a href="#Ended_its_career">{25}</a></span><br />

possession of Constantinople, and a terror to the<br />

the throne of Constantine; it began it as the<br />

consisting of Turks, which formed the guard of<br />
the Caliphs immediately after the time of Harun<br />

their master, burst into his apartment at the<br />
hour of supper, murdered him, and cut his body<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_128_10" id="PgLn_128_10">{10}</a></span><br />
into seven pieces. They got possession of the<br />
symbols of imperial power, the garment and the<br />
staff of Mahomet, and proceeded to make and<br />
unmake Caliphs at their pleasure. In the course<br />
of four years they had elevated, deposed, and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_128_15" id="PgLn_128_15">{15}</a></span><br />
murdered as many as three. At their wanton<br />
caprice, they made these successors of the false<br />

with iron clubs, and left them for days without<br />

<blockquote><p>Indeed, events were opening the way slowly,<br />
but surely, to their ascendancy. Throughout the<br />
whole of the tenth century, which followed, they<br />
seem to disappear from history; but a silent<br />
revolution was all along in progress, leading them<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_129_5" id="PgLn_129_5">{5}</a></span><br />
forward to their great destiny. The empire of<br />
the Caliphate was already dying in its<br />
extremities, and Sogdiana was one of the first countries<br />
to be detached from his power. The Turks were<br />
still there, and, as in Persia, filled the ranks of the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_129_10" id="PgLn_129_10">{10}</a></span><br />
army and the offices of the government; but the<br />
political changes which took place were not at<br />
first to their visible advantage. What first<br />
occurred was the revolt of the Caliph's viceroy,<br />
who made himself a great kingdom or empire out<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_129_15" id="PgLn_129_15">{15}</a></span><br />
of the provinces around, extending it from the<br />
Jaxartes, which was the northern boundary of<br />
Sogdiana, almost to the Indian Ocean, and<br />
from the confines of Georgia to the mountains<br />
of Afghanistan. The dynasty thus established<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_129_20" id="PgLn_129_20">{20}</a></span><br />
lasted for four generations and for the space of<br />
ninety years. Then the successor happened to<br />
be a boy; and one of his servants, the governor<br />
of Khorasan, an able and experienced man, was<br />
forced by circumstances to rebellion against him.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_129_25" id="PgLn_129_25"></a><a href="#Khorasan">{25}</a></span><br />
He was successful, and the whole power of this<br />
great kingdom fell into his hands; now he was a<br />
Tartar or Turk; and thus at length the Turks<br />
suddenly appear in history, the acknowledged<br />
masters of a southern dominion.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_129_30" id="PgLn_129_30">{30}</a></span><br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>This is the origin of the celebrated Turkish<br />
dynasty of the Gaznevides, so called after Gazneh,<br />
or Ghizni, or Ghuznee, the principal city, and it<br />
lasted for two hundred years. We are not<br />
particularly concerned in it, because it has no direct<br />
relations with Europe; but it falls into our<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_130_5" id="PgLn_130_5">{5}</a></span><br />
subject, as having been instrumental to the advance<br />
of the Turks towards the West. Its most<br />
distinguished monarch was Mahmood, and he<br />
conquered Hindostan, which became eventually<br />
the seat of the empire. In Mahmood the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_130_10" id="PgLn_130_10">{10}</a></span><br />
Gaznevide we have a prince of true Oriental splendor.<br />
For him the title of Sultan or Soldan was invented,<br />
which henceforth became the special badge of the<br />
Turkish monarchs; as Khan is the title of the<br />
sovereign of the Tartars, and Caliph of the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_130_15" id="PgLn_130_15">{15}</a></span><br />
sovereign of the Saracens. I have already described<br />
generally the extent of his dominions: he<br />
inherited Sogdiana, Carisme, Khorasan, and Cabul;<br />
but, being a zealous Mussulman, he obtained the<br />
title of Gazi, or champion, by his reduction of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_130_20" id="PgLn_130_20">{20}</a></span><br />
Hindostan, and his destruction of its idol<br />
temples. There was no need, however, of religious<br />
enthusiasm to stimulate him to the war: the<br />
riches, which he amassed in the course of it, were<br />
a recompense amply sufficient. His Indian<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_130_25" id="PgLn_130_25">{25}</a></span><br />
expeditions in all amounted to twelve, and they abound<br />
in battles and sieges of a truly Oriental cast....<br /></p></blockquote>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>and in a certain degree become acclimated in the<br />
countries where they settled. They first appear<br />
across the Jaxartes in the beginning of the seventh<br />
century; they have now come to the beginning<br />

have they been out of their deserts, gaining<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_131_5" id="PgLn_131_5">{5}</a></span><br />
experience and educating themselves in such<br />
measure as was necessary for playing their part in<br />
the civilized world. First they came down into<br />
Sogdiana and Khorasan, and the country below<br />
it, as conquerors; they continued in it as<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_131_10" id="PgLn_131_10">{10}</a></span><br />
subjects and slaves. They offered their services to<br />
the race which had subdued them; they made<br />
their way by means of their new masters down to<br />
the west and the south; they laid the foundations<br />
for their future supremacy in Persia, and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_131_15" id="PgLn_131_15">{15}</a></span><br />
gradually rose upwards through the social fabric to<br />
which they had been admitted, till they found<br />
themselves at length at the head of it. The<br />
sovereign power which they had acquired in the<br />
line of the Gaznevides, drifted off to Hindostan;<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_131_20" id="PgLn_131_20">{20}</a></span><br />
but still fresh tribes of their race poured down<br />
from the north, and filled up the gap; and while<br />
one dynasty of Turks was established in the<br />
peninsula, a second dynasty arose in the former<br />
seat of their power.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_131_25" id="PgLn_131_25">{25}</a></span><br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Now I call the era at which I have arrived the<br />

world....<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>But this era was a turning point in their<br />
history in another and more serious respect. In<br />

converts to the Mahometan faith. You will not<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_132_10" id="PgLn_132_10">{10}</a></span><br />
suppose I am going to praise a religious imposture,<br />
but no Catholic need deny that it is, considered<br />

Paganism has no rule of right and wrong, no<br />
supreme and immutable judge, no intelligible<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_132_15" id="PgLn_132_15">{15}</a></span><br />
revelation, no fixed dogma whatever; on the<br />
other hand, the being of one God, the fact of His<br />
revelation, His faithfulness to His promises, the<br />

retribution, were borrowed by Mahomet from the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_132_20" id="PgLn_132_20">{20}</a></span><br />
Church, and are steadfastly held by his followers.<br />
The false prophet taught much which is materially<br />

individuals who profess it. He stands in his<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_132_25" id="PgLn_132_25">{25}</a></span><br />
creed between the religion of God and the religion<br />
of devils, between Christianity and idolatry,<br />
between the West and the extreme East. And<br />
so stood the Turks, on adopting his faith, at<br />
the date I am speaking of; they stood between<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_132_30" id="PgLn_132_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>Christ in the West, and Satan in the East, and<br />
they had to make their choice; and, alas! they<br />
were led by the circumstances of the time to<br />
oppose themselves, not to Paganism, but to<br />
Christianity. A happier lot indeed had befallen<br />
poor Sultan Mahmood than befell his kindred<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_133_5" id="PgLn_133_5">{5}</a></span><br />
who followed in his wake. Mahmood, a<br />
Mahometan, went eastward and found a superstition<br />
worse than his own, and fought against it, and<br />
smote it; and the sandal doors which he tore<br />
away from the idol temple and hung up at his<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_133_10" id="PgLn_133_10">{10}</a></span><br />
tomb at Gazneh, almost seemed to plead for him<br />
through centuries as the soldier and the<br />
instrument of Heaven. The tribes which followed him,<br />
Moslem also, faced westward, and found, not<br />
error but truth, and fought against it as zealously,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_133_15" id="PgLn_133_15">{15}</a></span><br />
and in doing so, were simply tools of the Evil One,<br />
and preachers of a lie, and enemies, not witnesses<br />
of God. The one destroyed idol temples, the<br />
other Christian shrines. The one has been saved<br />

short reign to pass from humbling the Caliph to<br />
attacking the Greek Emperor. Togrul had<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_135_20" id="PgLn_135_20"></a><a href="#Greek_Emperor">{20}</a></span><br />
already invaded the Greek provinces of Asia Minor,<br />

and here it was that he had achieved his<br />
tremendous massacres of Christians. Alp Arslan<br />
renewed the war; he penetrated to Cesarea in<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_135_25" id="PgLn_135_25">{25}</a></span><br />
Cappadocia, attracted by the gold and pearls<br />
which incrusted the shrine of the great St. Basil.<br />

Georgia, and conquered the hardy mountaineers<br />

defeated, and captured the Greek Emperor. He<br />
began the battle with all the solemnity and<br />
pageantry of a hero of romance. Casting away<br />
his bow and arrows, he called for an iron mace and<br />
scimeter; he perfumed his body with musk, as<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_136_5" id="PgLn_136_5">{5}</a></span><br />
if for his burial, and dressed himself in white,<br />
that he might be slain in his winding sheet.<br />

dress; he made him kiss the ground beneath his<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_136_10" id="PgLn_136_10">{10}</a></span><br />
feet, and put his foot upon his neck. Then,<br />
raising him up, he struck or patted him three times<br />

large ransom, his liberty.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>At this time the Sultan was only forty-four<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_136_15" id="PgLn_136_15">{15}</a></span><br />
years of age, and seemed to have a career of glory<br />
still before him. Twelve hundred nobles stood<br />

own paternal wildernesses, with which his<br />
family, as I have related, had a feud. New tribes<br />

the Seljukians had wrested it from the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_136_25" id="PgLn_136_25">{25}</a></span><br />
Gaznevides. Alp had not advanced far into the<br />
country, when he met his death from the hand of a<br />
captive. A Carismian chief had withstood his<br />
progress, and, being taken, was condemned to a<br />
lingering execution. On hearing the sentence, he<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_136_30" id="PgLn_136_30">{30}</a></span><br />

disdaining to let his generals interfere, bent his<br />
bow, but, missing his aim, received the dagger of<br />
his prisoner in his breast. His death, which<br />
followed, brings before us that grave dignity of the<br />
Turkish character, of which we have already had<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_137_5" id="PgLn_137_5">{5}</a></span><br />
an example in Mahmood. Finding his end<br />
approaching, he has left on record a sort of dying<br />
confession: "In my youth," he said, "I was<br />
advised by a sage to humble myself before God,<br />
to distrust my own strength, and never to despise<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_137_10" id="PgLn_137_10">{10}</a></span><br />
the most contemptible foe. I have neglected<br />
these lessons, and my neglect has been deservedly<br />

of my armies; the earth seemed to tremble under<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_137_15" id="PgLn_137_15">{15}</a></span><br />

buried in the dust." <a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Alp Arslan was adorned<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_137_25" id="PgLn_137_25">{25}</a></span><br />

upheld the pure administration of justice, and<br />
protected the helpless and the innocent. He<br />

thousands of miles from him, and with prophetic<br />

himself with measures for averting it. Scarcely<br />

then upon the throne of the Apostle; and though<br />

almost fabulous East. In a letter written during<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_141_20" id="PgLn_141_20">{20}</a></span><br />

remark is made by a writer of the day: "The Turk<br />

the Turks, progressive they are not. This Sir<br />

a great deal, and brings us to a fresh<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_148_25" id="PgLn_148_25">{25}</a></span><br />

Their religion forbids them every sort of <span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_149_5" id="PgLn_149_5">{5}</a></span><br />
painting, sculpture, or engraving; thus the fine arts<br />
cannot exist among them. They have no music<br />

Their singing is in a great measure recitative,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_149_10" id="PgLn_149_10">{10}</a></span><br />
with little variation of note. They have scarcely<br />
any notion of medicine or surgery; and they do<br />
not allow of anatomy. As to science, the<br />
telescope, the microscope, the electric battery, are<br />
unknown, except as playthings. The compass <span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_149_15" id="PgLn_149_15">{15}</a></span><br />
is not universally employed in their navy, nor<br />
are its common purposes thoroughly understood.<br />

antiquated and exploded principles. As to their<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_149_20" id="PgLn_149_20">{20}</a></span><br />

<blockquote><p>What a contrast is presented to us by these<br />
different ideas of a universal empire! The<br />
distinctions of race are indelible; a Jew cannot<br />

their nation, as a nation, was ever to be<br />
dominant; and all other nations, as such, were<br />
inferior and subject. What was the necessary<br />
consequence? There is nothing men more pride<br />

thing impossible to Him&mdash;to undo what is<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_153_5" id="PgLn_153_5">{5}</a></span><br />
done. Without throwing the thought into a<br />
shape which borders on the profane, we may see<br />
in it the reason why the idea of national power<br />
was so dear and so dangerous to the Jew. It was<br />
his consciousness of inalienable superiority that<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_153_10" id="PgLn_153_10">{10}</a></span><br />
led him to regard Roman and Greek, Syrian and<br />
Egyptian, with ineffable arrogance and scorn.<br />
Christians, too, are accustomed to think of those<br />
who are not Christians as their inferiors; but the<br />
conviction which possesses them, that they have<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_153_15" id="PgLn_153_15">{15}</a></span><br />
what others have not, is obviously not open to<br />
the temptation which nationalism presents.<br />
According to their own faith, there is no insuperable<br />
gulf between themselves and the rest of mankind;<br />
there is not a being in the whole world but is<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_153_20" id="PgLn_153_20">{20}</a></span><br />
invited by their religion to occupy the same<br />
position as themselves, and, did he come, would<br />
stand on their very level, as if he had ever been<br />
there. Such accessions to their body they<br />
continually receive, and they are bound under<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_153_25" id="PgLn_153_25">{25}</a></span><br />
obligation of duty to promote them. They never<br />
can pronounce of any one, now external to them,<br />
that he will not some day be among them; they<br />
never can pronounce of themselves that, though<br />
they are now within, they may not some day<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_153_30" id="PgLn_153_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>be found outside, the Divine polity. Such are<br />
the sentiments inculcated by Christianity, even<br />
in the contemplation of the very superiority<br />
which it imparts; even there it is a principle, not<br />
of repulsion between man and man, but of good<br />
fellowship; but as to subjects of secular<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_154_5" id="PgLn_154_5"></a><a href="#Principle_of_superiority">{5}</a></span><br />
knowledge, since here it does not arrogate any<br />
superiority at all, it has in fact no tendency whatever<br />
to center its disciple's contemplation on himself,<br />
or to alienate him from his kind. He readily<br />
acknowledges and defers to the superiority in<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_154_10" id="PgLn_154_10">{10}</a></span><br />
art or science of those, if so be, who are<br />
unhappily enemies to Christianity. He admits the<br />
principle of progress on all matters of knowledge<br />
and conduct on which the Creator has not decided<br />
the truth already by revealing it; and he is at<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_154_15" id="PgLn_154_15">{15}</a></span><br />
all times ready to learn, in those merely secular<br />
matters, from those who can teach him best.<br />
Thus it is that Christianity, even negatively, and<br />
without contemplating its positive influences, is<br />

I need scarcely say, that is, the <i>litera scripta</i>,<br />
are one special instrument. It is true; and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_156_5" id="PgLn_156_5">{5}</a></span><br />
emphatically so in this age. Considering the<br />
prodigious powers of the press, and how they are<br />
developed at this time in the never intermitting<br />
issue of periodicals, tracts, pamphlets, works in<br />
series, and light literature, we must allow there<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_156_10" id="PgLn_156_10">{10}</a></span><br />
never was a time which promised fairer for<br />
dispensing with every other means of information<br />
and instruction. What can we want more, you<br />
will say, for the intellectual education of the<br />
whole man, and for every man, than so exuberant<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_156_15" id="PgLn_156_15">{15}</a></span><br />
and diversified and persistent a promulgation<br />
of all kinds of knowledge? Why, you will ask,<br />
need we go up to knowledge, when knowledge<br />
comes down to us? The Sibyl wrote her<br />
prophecies upon the leaves of the forest, and wasted<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_156_20" id="PgLn_156_20">{20}</a></span><br />
them; but here such careless profusion might be<br />
prudently indulged, for it can be afforded<br />
without loss, in consequence of the almost fabulous<br />
fecundity of the instrument which these latter<br />
ages have invented. We have sermons in stones,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_156_25" id="PgLn_156_25">{25}</a></span><br />
and books in the running brooks; works larger<br />
and more comprehensive than those which have<br />
gained for ancients an immortality, issue forth<br />
every morning, and are projected onwards to<br />
the ends of the earth at the rate of hundreds of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_156_30" id="PgLn_156_30">{30}</a></span><br />

catch all these from those in whom it lives<br />
already. You must imitate the student in French<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_158_15" id="PgLn_158_15">{15}</a></span><br />
or German, who is not content with his<br />
grammar, but goes to Paris or Dresden: you must<br />
take example from the young artist, who aspires<br />
to visit the great Masters in Florence and in<br />
Rome. Till we have discovered some<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_158_20" id="PgLn_158_20">{20}</a></span><br />
intellectual daguerreotype, which takes off the course of<br />

to learn wisdom, we must repair to the fountain,<br />
and drink there. Portions of it may go from<br />

ages, it was a work of long time; months,<br />
sometimes years, were devoted to the arduous task<br />
of disabusing the mind of the incipient Christian<br />
of its pagan errors, and of molding it upon the<br />
Christian faith. The Scriptures indeed were at<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_161_15" id="PgLn_161_15"></a><a href="#St_Irenaeus">{15}</a></span><br />

those times no evidence of want of learning: the<br />
hermits of the deserts were, in this sense of the<br />

disputation for the learned philosophers who came<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_161_25" id="PgLn_161_25">{25}</a></span><br />
to try him. Didymus again, the great<br />

must go to some great city or emporium for it.<br />
There you have all the choicest productions<br />

the riches of the land, and of the earth, are<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_162_15" id="PgLn_162_15">{15}</a></span><br />
carried up thither; there are the best markets, and<br />

some antagonist activity, and its judge in the<br />

error exposed, by the collision of mind with mind,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_163_5" id="PgLn_163_5">{5}</a></span><br />
and knowledge with knowledge. It is the place<br />
where the professor becomes eloquent, and is a<br />
missionary and a preacher, displaying his science<br />
in its most complete and most winning form,<br />
pouring it forth with the zeal of enthusiasm, and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_163_10" id="PgLn_163_10">{10}</a></span><br />
lighting up his own love of it in the breasts of<br />
his hearers. It is the place where the catechist<br />
makes good his ground as he goes, treading in the<br />
truth day by day into the ready memory, and<br />
wedging and tightening it into the expanding<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_163_15" id="PgLn_163_15">{15}</a></span><br />
reason. It is a place which wins the admiration<br />
of the young by its celebrity, kindles the<br />
affections of the middle-aged by its beauty, and rivets<br />
the fidelity of the old by its associations. It is a<br />
seat of wisdom, a light of the world, a minister of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_163_20" id="PgLn_163_20"></a><a href="#Its_associations">{20}</a></span><br />

describe it well.<br /></p></blockquote>

himself to Athens in search of wisdom? or, if he<br />

one of the noblest effusions of the kind in classical<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_165_5" id="PgLn_165_5">{5}</a></span><br />
poetry. Yet, even when he was the head of a<br />

Proresius, who was a friend of the captain's,<br />
and whose fame it was which drew the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_167_10" id="PgLn_167_10"></a><a href="#Proaeresius">{10}</a></span><br />
enthusiastic youth to Athens. His companions<br />
understand the sort of place they are in, and, with the<br />
license of academic students, they break into the<br />
philosopher's house, though he appears to have<br />
retired for the night, and proceed to make <span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_167_15" id="PgLn_167_15">{15}</a></span><br />
themselves free of it, with an absence of ceremony,<br />
which is only not impudence, because Proresius<br />
takes it so easily. Strange introduction for our<br />
stranger to a seat of learning, but not out of<br />
keeping with Athens; for what could you expect of a<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_167_20" id="PgLn_167_20">{20}</a></span><br />
place where there was a mob of youths and not<br />
even the pretense of control; where the poorer<br />
lived any how, and got on as they could, and the<br />
teachers themselves had no protection from the<br />
humors and caprices of the students who filled<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_167_25" id="PgLn_167_25">{25}</a></span><br />
their lecture halls? However, as to this<br />
Eunapius, Proresius took a fancy to the boy, and told<br />
him curious stories about Athenian life. He<br />
himself had come up to the University with one<br />
Hephstion, and they were even worse off than<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_167_30" id="PgLn_167_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>Cleanthes the Stoic; for they had only one cloak<br />
between them, and nothing whatever besides,<br />
except some old bedding; so when Proresius<br />
went abroad, Hephstion lay in bed, and<br />
practiced himself in oratory; and then Hephstion<br />
put on the cloak, and Proresius crept under the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_168_5" id="PgLn_168_5">{5}</a></span><br />
coverlet. At another time there was so fierce<br />
a feud between what would be called "town and<br />
gown" in an English University, that the<br />
Professors did not dare lecture in public, for fear of<br />
ill treatment.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_168_10" id="PgLn_168_10">{10}</a></span><br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>But a freshman like Eunapius soon got<br />
experience for himself of the ways and manners<br />
prevalent in Athens. Such a one as he had hardly<br />
entered the city, when he was caught hold of by<br />
a party of the academic youth, who proceeded to<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_168_15" id="PgLn_168_15">{15}</a></span><br />
practice on his awkwardness and his ignorance.<br />
At first sight one wonders at their childishness;<br />
but the like conduct obtained in the medival<br />
Universities; and not many months have passed<br />
away since the journals have told us of sober<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_168_20" id="PgLn_168_20">{20}</a></span><br />
Englishmen, given to matter-of-fact calculations,<br />
and to the anxieties of money making, pelting<br />
each other with snowballs on their own sacred<br />
territory, and defying the magistracy, when they<br />
would interfere with their privileges of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_168_25" id="PgLn_168_25">{25}</a></span><br />
becoming boys. So I suppose we must attribute it to<br />
something or other in human nature. Meanwhile,<br />
there stands the newcomer, surrounded by a circle<br />
of his new associates, who forthwith proceed to<br />
frighten, and to banter, and to make a fool of him,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_168_30" id="PgLn_168_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>to the extent of their wit. Some address him with<br />
mock politeness, others with fierceness; and so<br />
they conduct him in solemn procession across the<br />
Agora to the Baths; and as they approach, they<br />
dance about him like madmen. But this was to<br />
be the end of his trial, for the Bath was a sort of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_169_5" id="PgLn_169_5">{5}</a></span><br />
initiation; he thereupon received the pallium, or<br />
University gown, and was suffered by his<br />
tormentors to depart in peace. One alone is<br />
recorded as having been exempted from this<br />
persecution; it was a youth graver and loftier than<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_169_10" id="PgLn_169_10">{10}</a></span><br />
even St. Gregory himself: but it was not from his<br />
force of character, but at the instance of Gregory,<br />
that he escaped. Gregory was his bosom friend,<br />
and was ready in Athens to shelter him when<br />
he came. It was another Saint and Doctor; the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_169_15" id="PgLn_169_15">{15}</a></span><br />
great Basil, then, (it would appear,) as Gregory,<br />
but a catechumen of the Church.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>But to return to our freshman. His troubles<br />
are not at an end, though he has got his gown<br />
upon him. Where is he to lodge? whom is he<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_169_20" id="PgLn_169_20">{20}</a></span><br />
to attend? He finds himself seized, before he<br />
well knows where he is, by another party of men<br />
or three or four parties at once, like foreign<br />
porters at a landing, who seize on the baggage of the<br />
perplexed stranger, and thrust half a dozen cards<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_169_25" id="PgLn_169_25">{25}</a></span><br />
into his unwilling hands. Our youth is plied by<br />
the hangers-on of professor this, or sophist that,<br />

having a houseful. We will say that he escapes<br />
from their hands,&mdash;but then he will have to<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_169_30" id="PgLn_169_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>choose for himself where he will put up; and, to<br />
tell the truth, with all the praise I have already<br />
given, and the praise I shall have to give, to<br />
the city of mind, nevertheless, between ourselves,<br />
the brick and wood which formed it, the actual<br />
tenements, where flesh and blood had to lodge<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_170_5" id="PgLn_170_5">{5}</a></span><br />
(always excepting the mansions of great men of<br />
the place), do not seem to have been much better<br />
than those of Greek or Turkish towns, which are<br />
at this moment a topic of interest and ridicule<br />
in the public prints. A lively picture has lately<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_170_10" id="PgLn_170_10"></a><a href="#Gallipoli">{10}</a></span><br />
been set before us of Gallipoli. Take, says the<br />
writer,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> a multitude of the dilapidated outhouses<br />
found in farm-yards in England, of the rickety<br />
old wooden tenements, the cracked, shutterless<br />
structures of planks and tiles, the sheds and stalls,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_170_15" id="PgLn_170_15">{15}</a></span><br />
which our bye lanes, or fish-markets, or<br />
river-sides can supply; tumble them down on the<br />
declivity of a bare bald hill; let the spaces<br />
between house and house, thus accidentally<br />
determined, be understood to form streets, winding of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_170_20" id="PgLn_170_20">{20}</a></span><br />
course for no reason, and with no meaning, up and<br />
down the town; the roadway always narrow, the<br />
breadth never uniform, the separate houses<br />
bulging or retiring below, as circumstances may have<br />
determined, and leaning forward till they meet<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_170_25" id="PgLn_170_25">{25}</a></span><br />
overhead&mdash;and you have a good idea of<br />
Gallipoli. I question whether this picture would<br />
not nearly correspond to the special seat of the<br />
Muses in ancient times. Learned writers assure<br />
us distinctly that the houses of Athens were for<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_170_30" id="PgLn_170_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>the most part small and mean; that the streets<br />
were crooked and narrow; that the upper stories<br />
projected over the roadway; and that staircases,<br />
balustrades, and doors that opened outwards<br />
obstructed it&mdash;a remarkable coincidence of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_171_5" id="PgLn_171_5">{5}</a></span><br />
description. I do not doubt at all, though<br />
history is silent, that that roadway was jolting to<br />
carriages, and all but impassable; and that it<br />
was traversed by drains, as freely as any Turkish<br />
town now. Athens seems in these respects to<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_171_10" id="PgLn_171_10">{10}</a></span><br />
have been below the average cities of its time.<br />
"A stranger," says an ancient, "might doubt, on<br />
the sudden view, if really he saw Athens."<br /></p></blockquote>

morning; and not till night, if even then, will he<br />
return. It is but a crib or kennel, in which<br />
he sleeps when the weather is inclement or the<br />
ground damp; in no respect a home. And he<br />
goes out of doors, not to read the day's<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_172_25" id="PgLn_172_25">{25}</a></span><br />
newspaper, or to buy the gay shilling volume, but to<br />

Out he goes; and, leaving the tumble-down<br />

the right, or he turns to the Areopagus on the left.<br />
He goes to the Parthenon to study the sculptures <span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_173_5" id="PgLn_173_5"></a><a href="#Areopagus">{5}</a></span><br />
of Phidias; to the temple of the Dioscuri to see<br />
the paintings of Polygnotus. We indeed take<br />
our Sophocles or schylus out of our coat pocket;<br />

himself to the theater on the south, and see and<br />

westward to the Agora, and there he will hear<br />

shade of those noble planes, which Cimon has<br />

itself a work of genius and skill, enough to be the<br />
making of another city. He passes through the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_173_20" id="PgLn_173_20"></a><a href="#Agora">{20}</a></span><br />

which will be taught him day after day by teacher<br />

by one object; it is the very presence of Plato.<br />
He does not hear a word that he says; he does<br />
not care to hear; he asks neither for discourse<br />

complete in itself, not to be increased by addition, and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_174_10" id="PgLn_174_10">{10}</a></span><br />
greater than anything else. It will be a point in<br />
the history of his life; a stay for his memory to<br />
rest on, a burning thought in his heart, a bond of<br />

Such is the spell which the living man exerts on<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_174_15" id="PgLn_174_15">{15}</a></span><br />

and something to tell of to his grandchildren.<br /></p></blockquote>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>many centuries later; and they imply a sort of<br />

the schools. No awful arch, no window of<br />

Epicurus is reclining in his garden; Zeno looks<br />
like a divinity in his porch; the restless Aristotle,<br />
on the other side of the city, as if in antagonism<br />
to Plato, is walking his pupils off their legs in his<br />
Lyceum by the Ilyssus. Our student has<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_175_20" id="PgLn_175_20">{20}</a></span><br />

Theophrastus, a teacher of marvelous popularity, who<br />

numbers, unless she had selected teachers of such<br />
power? it was the range of territory, which the<br />

the other. Anaxagoras was from Ionia, Carneades<br />
from Africa, Zeno from Cyprus, Protagoras from<br />
Thrace, and Gorgias from Sicily. Andromachus<br />

a Bithynian, Philiscus a Thessalian, Hadrian a<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_176_5" id="PgLn_176_5">{5}</a></span><br />
Syrian. Rome is celebrated for her liberality in<br />
civil matters; Athens was as liberal in<br />
intellectual. There was no narrow jealousy, directed<br />
against a Professor, because he was not an<br />
Athenian; genius and talent were the qualifications;<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_176_10" id="PgLn_176_10">{10}</a></span><br />
and to bring them to Athens, was to do homage<br />
to it as a University. There was a brotherhood<br />

much gain whenever an Herodes Atticus is found,<br />
to throw the influence of wealth and station on<br />
the side even of a decorous philosophy. A<br />
consular man, and the heir of an ample fortune, this<br />
Herod was content to devote his life to a<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_178_10" id="PgLn_178_10">{10}</a></span><br />
professorship, and his fortune to the patronage of<br />
literature. He gave the sophist Polemo about<br />
eight thousand pounds, as the sum is calculated,<br />
for three declamations. He built at Athens a<br />
stadium six hundred feet long, entirely of white<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_178_15" id="PgLn_178_15">{15}</a></span><br />
marble, and capable of admitting the whole<br />
population. His theater, erected to the memory of<br />
his wife, was made of cedar wood curiously carved.<br />
He had two villas, one at Marathon, the place of<br />
his birth, about ten miles from Athens, the other<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_178_20" id="PgLn_178_20">{20}</a></span><br />
at Cephissia, at the distance of six; and thither<br />
he drew to him the <i>&egrave;lite</i>, and at times the whole<br />
body of the students. Long arcades, groves of<br />
trees, clear pools for the bath, delighted and<br />
recruited the summer visitor. Never was so<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_178_25" id="PgLn_178_25">{25}</a></span><br />
brilliant a lecture room as his evening<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>met with a reception, courteous always, but suitable<br />
to his deserts. Herod was noted for his<br />
repartees; and we have instances on record of<br />
his setting down, according to the emergency,<br />
both the one and the other.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>A higher line, though a rarer one, was that<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_179_5" id="PgLn_179_5">{5}</a></span><br />
allotted to the youthful Basil. He was one of<br />
those men who seem by a sort of fascination to<br />
draw others around them even without wishing<br />
it. One might have deemed that his gravity and<br />
his reserve would have kept them at a distance;<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_179_10" id="PgLn_179_10">{10}</a></span><br />
but, almost in spite of himself, he was the center<br />
of a knot of youths, who, pagans as most of them<br />
were, used Athens honestly for the purpose for<br />
which they professed to seek it; and, disappointed<br />
and displeased with the place himself, he seems<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_179_15" id="PgLn_179_15">{15}</a></span><br />
nevertheless to have been the means of their<br />
profiting by its advantages. One of these was<br />
Sophronius, who afterwards held a high office in<br />
the State: Eusebius was another, at that time<br />
the bosom friend of Sophronius, and afterwards<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_179_20" id="PgLn_179_20">{20}</a></span><br />
a Bishop. Celsus too is named, who afterwards<br />
was raised to the government of Cilicia by the<br />
Emperor Julian. Julian himself, in the sequel of<br />
unhappy memory, was then at Athens, and known<br />
at least to St. Gregory. Another Julian is also<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_179_25" id="PgLn_179_25">{25}</a></span><br />
mentioned, who was afterwards commissioner of<br />
the land tax. Here we have a glimpse of the better<br />
kind of society among the students of Athens; and<br />
it is to the credit of the parties composing it,<br />
that such young men as Gregory and Basil, men<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_179_30" id="PgLn_179_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>as intimately connected with Christianity, as they<br />
were well known in the world, should hold so high<br />
a place in their esteem and love. When the two<br />
saints were departing, their companions came<br />
around them with the hope of changing their<br />
purpose. Basil persevered; but Gregory relented,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_180_5" id="PgLn_180_5">{5}</a></span><br />
and turned back to Athens for a season.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>It is most interesting to observe how the<br />
foundations of the present intellectual greatness<br />
of Europe were laid, and most wonderful to think<br />
that they were ever laid at all. Let us consider<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_180_10" id="PgLn_180_10">{10}</a></span><br />
how wide and how high is the platform of our<br />

will in future times be nothing better than a poor<br />
beginning; and then on the other hand, let us<br />
recollect that, seven centuries ago, putting aside<br />
revealed truths, Europe had little more than that<br />
poor knowledge, partial and uncertain, and at<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_180_20" id="PgLn_180_20">{20}</a></span><br />
best only practical, which is conveyed to us by the<br />
senses. Even our first principles now are beyond<br />

compared with pagan, is true in its way and degree<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_180_25" id="PgLn_180_25">{25}</a></span><br />
of the progress of secular knowledge also in the<br />

<blockquote><p>Nor is this the only point in which the<br />
revelations of science may be compared to the<br />
supernatural revelations of Christianity. Though<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_181_5" id="PgLn_181_5">{5}</a></span><br />
sacred truth was delivered once for all, and<br />
scientific discoveries are progressive, yet there is<br />
a great resemblance in the respective histories of<br />
Christianity and of Science. We are accustomed<br />
to point to the rise and spread of Christianity as<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_181_10" id="PgLn_181_10">{10}</a></span><br />
a miraculous fact, and rightly so, on account of<br />
the weakness of its instruments, and the appalling<br />
weight and multiplicity of the obstacles which<br />
confronted it. To clear away those obstacles<br />
was to move mountains; yet this was done by<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_181_15" id="PgLn_181_15">{15}</a></span><br />
a few poor, obscure, unbefriended men, and<br />
their poor, obscure, unbefriended followers. No<br />
social movement can come up to this marvel,<br />
which is singular and archetypical, certainly;<br />
it is a Divine work, and we soon cease to admire<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_181_20" id="PgLn_181_20">{20}</a></span><br />
it in order to adore. But there is more in it<br />
than its own greatness to contemplate; it is so<br />
great as to be prolific of greatness. Those whom<br />
it has created, its children who have become such<br />
by a supernatural power, have imitated, in their<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_181_25" id="PgLn_181_25">{25}</a></span><br />
own acts, the dispensation which made them<br />
what they were; and, though they have not<br />
carried out works simply miraculous, yet they have<br />
done exploits sufficient to bespeak their own<br />
unearthly origin, and the new powers which had<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_181_30" id="PgLn_181_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>come into the world. The revival of letters by<br />
the energy of Christian ecclesiastics and laymen,<br />
when everything had to be done, reminds us of<br />
the birth of Christianity itself, as far as a work of<br />
man can resemble a work of God.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Two characteristics, as I have already had<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_182_5" id="PgLn_182_5">{5}</a></span><br />
occasion to say, are generally found to attend the<br />
history of Science: first, its instruments have<br />
an innate force, and can dispense with foreign<br />
assistance in their work; and secondly, these<br />
instruments must exist and must begin to act,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_182_10" id="PgLn_182_10">{10}</a></span><br />
before subjects are found who are to profit by<br />
their action. In plainer language, the teacher is<br />
strong, not in the patronage of great men, but<br />
in the intrinsic value and attraction of what he<br />
has to communicate; and next, he must come<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_182_15" id="PgLn_182_15">{15}</a></span><br />
forward and advertise himself, before he can gain<br />
hearers. This I have expressed before, in saying<br />
that a great school of learning lived in demand and<br />
supply, and that the supply must be before the<br />
demand. Now, what is this but the very history<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_182_20" id="PgLn_182_20">{20}</a></span><br />
of the preaching of the Gospel? who but the<br />
Apostles and Evangelists went out to the ends<br />
of the earth without patron, or friend, or other<br />
external advantage which could insure their<br />
success? and again, who among the multitude they<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_182_25" id="PgLn_182_25">{25}</a></span><br />
enlightened would have called for their aid unless<br />
they had gone to that multitude first, and offered<br />
to it blessings which up to that moment it had<br />
not heard of? They had no commission, they<br />
had no invitation, from man; their strength lay<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_182_30" id="PgLn_182_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>neither in their being sent, nor in their being sent<br />
for; but in the circumstances that they had that<br />
with them, a Divine message, which they knew<br />
would at once, when it was uttered, thrill through<br />
the hearts of those to whom they spoke, and<br />
make for themselves friends in any place,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_183_5" id="PgLn_183_5">{5}</a></span><br />
strangers and outcasts as they were when they first<br />
came. They appealed to the secret wants and<br />
aspirations of human nature, to its laden<br />
conscience, its weariness, its desolateness, and its<br />
sense of the true and the Divine; nor did they<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_183_10" id="PgLn_183_10">{10}</a></span><br />
long wait for listeners and disciples, when they<br />
announced the remedy of evils which were so real.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Something like this were the first stages of the<br />
process by which in medival Christendom the<br />
structure of our present intellectual elevation<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_183_15" id="PgLn_183_15">{15}</a></span><br />
was carried forward. From Rome as from a<br />
center, as the Apostles from Jerusalem, went<br />
forth the missionaries of knowledge, passing to<br />
and fro all over Europe; and, as Metropolitan<br />
sees were the record of the presence of Apostles,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_183_20" id="PgLn_183_20"></a><a href="#Paris">{20}</a></span><br />
so did Paris, Pavia, and Bologna, and Padua,<br />
and Ferrara, Pisa and Naples, Vienna, Louvain,<br />
and Oxford, rise into Universities at the voice of<br />
the theologian or the philosopher. Moreover, as<br />
the Apostles went through labors untold, by<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_183_25" id="PgLn_183_25">{25}</a></span><br />
sea and land, in their charity to souls; so, if<br />
robbers, shipwrecks, bad lodging, and scanty fare<br />
are trials of zeal, such trials were encountered<br />
without hesitation by the martyrs and confessors<br />
of science. And as Evangelists had grounded<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_183_30" id="PgLn_183_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>their teaching upon the longing for happiness<br />
natural to man, so did these securely rest their<br />
cause on the natural thirst for knowledge: and<br />
again as the preachers of Gospel peace had often<br />
to bewail the ruin which persecution or<br />
dissension had brought upon their nourishing colonies,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_184_5" id="PgLn_184_5">{5}</a></span><br />
so also did the professors of science often find or<br />
flee the ravages of sword or pestilence in those<br />
places, which they themselves perhaps in former<br />
times had made the seats of religious, honorable,<br />
and useful learning. And lastly, as kings and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_184_10" id="PgLn_184_10">{10}</a></span><br />
nobles have fortified and advanced the interests<br />
of the Christian faith without being necessary<br />
to it, so in like manner we may enumerate with<br />
honor Charlemagne, Alfred, Henry the First of<br />
England, Joan of Navarre, and many others, as<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_184_15" id="PgLn_184_15">{15}</a></span><br />
patrons of the schools of learning, without being<br />
obliged to allow that those schools could not have<br />
progressed without such countenance.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>These are some of the points of resemblance<br />
between the propagation of Christian truth and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_184_20" id="PgLn_184_20">{20}</a></span><br />
the revival of letters; and, to return to the two<br />
points, to which I have particularly drawn<br />
attention, the University Professor's confidence in his<br />

exercise of them, I find both these distinctly<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_184_25" id="PgLn_184_25">{25}</a></span><br />
recognized by Mr. Hallam in his history of Literature.<br />
As to the latter point, he says, "The schools of<br />
Charlemagne were designed to lay the basis of a<br />
learned education, <i>for which there was at that time<br />
no sufficient desire</i>"&mdash;that is, the supply was<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_184_30" id="PgLn_184_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>prior to the demand. As to the former: "In<br />
the twelfth century," he says, "the <i>impetuosity</i><br />
with which men <i>rushed</i> to that source of what<br />
they deemed wisdom, the great University of<br />
Paris, <i>did not depend upon academical privileges<br />
or eleemosynary stipends</i>, though these were<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_185_5" id="PgLn_185_5">{5}</a></span><br />
undoubtedly very effectual in keeping it up. The<br />
University <i>created patrons, and was not created<br />

in all....<br /></p></blockquote>

the eleventh century by an illiterate soldier, who<br />
sought the cloister, soon attracted scholars to its<br />
dreary clime from Italy, and transmitted them<br />
to England. Lanfranc, afterwards Archbishop of<br />
Canterbury, was one of these, and he found the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_185_15" id="PgLn_185_15">{15}</a></span><br />
simple monks so necessitous, that he opened a<br />
school of logic to all comers, in order, says William<br />
of Malmesbury, "that he might support his needy<br />
monastery by the pay of the students." The<br />
same author adds, that "his reputation went into<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_185_20" id="PgLn_185_20">{20}</a></span><br />
the most remote parts of the Latin world, and<br />
Bec became a great and famous Academy of<br />

to attract scholars, and in them to find support.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_185_25" id="PgLn_185_25">{25}</a></span><br />
William of Jumi&egrave;ges, too, bears witness to the<br />
effect, powerful, sudden, wide spreading, and<br />

precision, under diverse forms, with fuller<br />

to a certain point what she is about to say or<br />

some misshapen, huge, and grotesque foreshadow<br />

to meet them with those divinely<br />
appointed correctives which the Church alone can<br />
apply, and which she will actually apply, when<br />

of St. Irenus, St. Athanasius, and St.<br />

professed. Apollinaris anticipated the work of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_188_10" id="PgLn_188_10">{10}</a></span><br />
St. Cyril and the Ephesine Council, and became<br />

the Church, because she would not adopt their<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_188_15" id="PgLn_188_15">{15}</a></span><br />
views, would have found, had they but trusted<br />
her, and waited, that she knew how to profit by<br />
them, though she never could have need to<br />
borrow her enunciations from them; for their<br />
writings contained, so to speak, truth <i>in the ore</i>, truth<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_188_20" id="PgLn_188_20">{20}</a></span><br />
which they themselves had not the gift to<br />

had continued, with various fortunes, faithful, as<br />
far as the age admitted, to the old learning, as<br />
other schools elsewhere, when, in the eleventh<br />
century, the famous school of Bec began to<br />
develop the powers of logic in forming a new<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_190_20" id="PgLn_190_20">{20}</a></span><br />
philosophy. As the inductive method rose in<br />
Bacon, so did the logical in the medival<br />

conceived the sublime idea of mapping the whole<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_190_25" id="PgLn_190_25">{25}</a></span><br />
field of knowledge, and subjecting all things to<br />
one profound analysis, became the presiding<br />
master in their lecture halls. It was at the end<br />
of the eleventh century that William of<br />
Champeaux founded the celebrated Abbey of St.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_190_30" id="PgLn_190_30">{30}</a></span><br />

the dialectic methods which he introduced into his<br />
teaching, has a claim to have commenced the<br />
work of forming the University out of the Schools<br />
of Paris. For one at least, out of the two<br />
characteristics of a University, he prepared the way;<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_191_5" id="PgLn_191_5">{5}</a></span><br />
for, though the schools were not public till after<br />
his day, so as to admit laymen as well as clerks,<br />
and foreigners as well as natives of the place, yet<br />
the logical principle of constructing all sciences<br />
into one system, implied of course a recognition<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_191_10" id="PgLn_191_10">{10}</a></span><br />
of all the sciences that are comprehended in it.<br />
Of this William of Champeaux, or de Campellis,<br />
Abelard was the pupil; he had studied the<br />
dialectic art elsewhere, before he offered himself for<br />
his instructions; and, in the course of two years,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_191_15" id="PgLn_191_15">{15}</a></span><br />
when as yet he had only reached the age of<br />
twenty-two, he made such progress, as to be<br />
capable of quarreling with his master, and<br />
setting up a school for himself.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>This school of Abelard was first situated in<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_191_20" id="PgLn_191_20">{20}</a></span><br />
the royal castle of Melun; then at Corbeil, which<br />
was nearer to Paris, and where he attracted to<br />
himself a considerable number of hearers. His<br />
labors had an injurious effect upon his health;<br />
and at length he withdrew for two years to his<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_191_25" id="PgLn_191_25">{25}</a></span><br />
native Britanny. Whether other causes co&ouml;perated<br />
in this withdrawal, I think, is not known;<br />
but, at the end of the two years, we find him<br />
returning to Paris, and renewing his attendance<br />
on the lectures of William, who was by this time<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_191_30" id="PgLn_191_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>a monk. Rhetoric was the subject of the lectures<br />
he now heard; and after a while the pupil<br />
repeated with greater force and success his<br />
former treatment of his teacher. He held a<br />
public disputation with him, got the victory,<br />
and reduced him to silence. The school of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_192_5" id="PgLn_192_5">{5}</a></span><br />
William was deserted, and its master himself became<br />
an instance of the vicissitudes incident to that<br />
gladiatorial wisdom (as I may style it) which was<br />
then eclipsing the old Benedictine method of the<br />
Seven Arts. After a time, Abelard found his<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_192_10" id="PgLn_192_10"></a><a href="#The_Seven_Arts">{10}</a></span><br />
reputation sufficient to warrant him in setting<br />
up a school himself on Mount St. Genevi&egrave;ve;<br />
whence he waged incessant war against the<br />
unwearied logician, who by this time had rallied<br />
his forces to repel the young and ungrateful<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_192_15" id="PgLn_192_15">{15}</a></span><br />
adventurer who had raised his hand against him.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Great things are done by devotion to one idea;<br />

The calm philosophical mind, which<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_192_20" id="PgLn_192_20">{20}</a></span><br />
contemplates parts without denying the whole, and the<br />
whole without confusing the parts, is notoriously<br />

more, whatever their merit, must be to a certain<br />
extent narrow-minded; and it is not wonderful<br />
that Abelard's devotion to the new philosophy<br />
made him undervalue the Seven Arts out of which<br />
it had grown. He felt it impossible so to honor<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_192_30" id="PgLn_192_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>what was now to be added, as not to dishonor<br />
what existed before. He would not suffer the<br />
Arts to have their own use, since he had found a<br />
new instrument for a new purpose. So he<br />
opposed the reading of the Classics. The monks<br />
had opposed them before him; but this is little<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_193_5" id="PgLn_193_5">{5}</a></span><br />
to our present purpose; it was the duty of men,<br />
who abjured the gifts of this world on the<br />
principle of mortification, to deny themselves<br />
literature just as they would deny themselves<br />
particular friendships or figured music. The doctrine<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_193_10" id="PgLn_193_10">{10}</a></span><br />
which Abelard introduced and represents was<br />
founded on a different basis. He did not<br />
recognize in the poets of antiquity any other merit<br />
than that of furnishing an assemblage of elegant<br />
phrases and figures; and accordingly he asks<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_193_15" id="PgLn_193_15">{15}</a></span><br />
why they should not be banished from the city<br />
of God, since Plato banished them from his own<br />
commonwealth. The <i>animus</i> of this language is<br />
clear, when we turn to the pages of John of<br />
Salisbury and Peter of Blois, who were champions of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_193_20" id="PgLn_193_20"></a><a href="#John_of_Salisbury">{20}</a></span><br />
the ancient learning. We find them complaining<br />
that the careful "getting up," as we now call it,<br />
"of books," was growing out of fashion. Youths<br />
once studied critically the text of poets or<br />
philosophers; they got them by heart; they analyzed<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_193_25" id="PgLn_193_25">{25}</a></span><br />
their arguments; they noted down their fallacies;<br />
they were closely examined in the matters which<br />
had been brought before them in lecture; they<br />
composed. But now, another teaching was<br />
coming in; students were promised truth in a<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_193_30" id="PgLn_193_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>nutshell; they intended to get possession of the sum-total<br />
of philosophy in less than two or three<br />
years; and facts were apprehended, not in their<br />
substance and details, by means of living and,<br />
as it were, personal documents, but in dead<br />
abstracts and tables. Such were the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_194_5" id="PgLn_194_5">{5}</a></span><br />
reclamations to which the new Logic gave occasion.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>These, however, are lesser matters; we have<br />
a graver quarrel with Abelard than that of his<br />
undervaluing the Classics. As I have said, my<br />
main object here is not what he taught, but why<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_194_10" id="PgLn_194_10">{10}</a></span><br />
and how, and how he lived. Now it is certain<br />
his activity was stimulated by nothing very high,<br />
but something very earthly and sordid. I grant<br />
there is nothing morally wrong in the mere desire<br />
to rise in the world, though Ambition and it are<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_194_15" id="PgLn_194_15">{15}</a></span><br />
twin sisters. I should not blame Abelard merely<br />
for wishing to distinguish himself at the<br />
University; but when he makes the ecclesiastical<br />
state the instrument of his ambition, mixes up<br />
spiritual matters with temporal, and aims at a<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_194_20" id="PgLn_194_20">{20}</a></span><br />
bishopric through the medium of his logic, he<br />
joins together things incompatible, and cannot<br />
complain of being censured. It is he himself,<br />
who tells us, unless my memory plays me false,<br />
that the circumstance of William of Champeaux<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_194_25" id="PgLn_194_25">{25}</a></span><br />
being promoted to the see of Chalons, was an<br />
incentive to him to pursue the same path with an<br />
eye to the same reward. Accordingly, we next<br />
hear of his attending the theological lectures of<br />
a certain master of William's, named Anselm, an<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_194_30" id="PgLn_194_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>old man, whose school was situated at Laon. This<br />
person had a great reputation in his day; John<br />
of Salisbury, speaking of him in the next<br />
generation, calls him the doctor of doctors; he had been<br />
attended by students from Italy and Germany;<br />
but the age had advanced since he was in his<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_195_5" id="PgLn_195_5">{5}</a></span><br />
prime, and Abelard was disappointed in a teacher,<br />
who had been good enough for William. He left<br />
Anselm, and began to lecture on the prophet<br />
Ezekiel on his own resources.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Now came the time of his great popularity,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_195_10" id="PgLn_195_10">{10}</a></span><br />
which was more than his head could bear; which<br />
dizzied him, took him off his legs, and whirled<br />
him to his destruction. I spoke in my foregoing<br />
Chapter of those three qualities of true wisdom,<br />
which a University, absolutely and nakedly<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_195_15" id="PgLn_195_15"></a><a href="#St_James_iii_17">{15}</a></span><br />
considered, apart from the safeguards which<br />
constitute its integrity, is sure to compromise.<br />
Wisdom, says the inspired writer, is <i>desursum</i>, is<br />
<i>pudica</i>, is <i>pacifica</i>, "from above, chaste,<br />
peaceable." We have already seen enough of Abelard's<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_195_20" id="PgLn_195_20"></a><a href="#St_James_iii_6">{20}</a></span><br />
career to understand that his wisdom, instead of<br />
being "pacifica," was ambitious and contentious.<br />
An Apostle speaks of the tongue both as a blessing<br />
and as a curse. It may be the beginning of a fire,<br />
he says, a "Universitas iniquitatis"; and alas!<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_195_25" id="PgLn_195_25">{25}</a></span><br />
such did it become in the mouth of the gifted<br />
Abelard. His eloquence was wonderful; he<br />
dazzled his contemporaries, says Fulco, "by the<br />
brilliancy of his genius, the sweetness of his<br />
eloquence, the ready flow of his language, and the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_195_30" id="PgLn_195_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>subtlety of his knowledge." People came to<br />
him from all quarters&mdash;from Rome, in spite of<br />
mountains and robbers; from England, in spite<br />
of the sea; from Flanders and Germany; from<br />
Normandy, and the remote districts of France;<br />
from Angers and Poitiers; from Navarre by the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_196_5" id="PgLn_196_5">{5}</a></span><br />
Pyrenees, and from Spain, besides the students<br />
of Paris itself; and among those, who sought his<br />
instructions now or afterwards, were the great<br />
luminaries of the schools in the next generation.<br />
Such were Peter of Poitiers, Peter Lombard, John<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_196_10" id="PgLn_196_10">{10}</a></span><br />
of Salisbury, Arnold of Brescia, Ivo, and Geoffrey<br />
of Auxerre. It was too much for a weak head<br />
and heart, weak in spite of intellectual power;<br />
for vanity will possess the head, and worldliness<br />
the heart, of the man, however gifted, whose<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_196_15" id="PgLn_196_15">{15}</a></span><br />
wisdom is not an effluence of the Eternal Light.<br /></p></blockquote>

to one series of events and scene of action, it<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_200_15" id="PgLn_200_15">{15}</a></span><br />
bounds and finishes off the confused luxuriance<br />
of real nature; while, by a skillful adjustment of<br />
circumstances, it brings into sight the connection<br />
of cause and effect, completes the dependence of<br />
the parts one on another, and harmonizes the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_200_20" id="PgLn_200_20">{20}</a></span><br />
proportions of the whole. It is then but the type<br />
and model of history or biography, if we may be<br />

to the abstract mathematical formul of physics,<br />
before they are modified by the contingencies of<br />
atmosphere and friction. Hence, while it recreates<br />
the imagination by the superhuman loveliness of<br />
its views, it provides a solace for the mind broken<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_201_5" id="PgLn_201_5">{5}</a></span><br />
by the disappointments and sufferings of actual<br />
life; and becomes, moreover, the utterance of<br />
the inward emotions of a right moral feeling,<br />
seeking a purity and a truth which this world<br />
will not give.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_201_10" id="PgLn_201_10">{10}</a></span><br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>It follows that the poetical mind is one full of<br />
the eternal forms of beauty and perfection; these<br />
are its material of thought, its instrument and<br />
medium of observation; these color each<br />
object to which it directs its view. It is called<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_201_15" id="PgLn_201_15">{15}</a></span><br />
imaginative, or creative, from the originality and<br />
independence of its modes of thinking, compared<br />
with the commonplace and matter-of-fact<br />
conceptions of ordinary minds which are fettered<br />
down to the particular and individual. At the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_201_20" id="PgLn_201_20">{20}</a></span><br />
same time it feels a natural sympathy with<br />
everything great and splendid in the physical and<br />
moral world; and selecting such from the mass<br />
of common phenomena, incorporates them, as it<br />
were, into the substance of its own creations.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_201_25" id="PgLn_201_25">{25}</a></span><br />
From living thus in a world of its own, it speaks<br />
the language of dignity, emotion, and refinement.<br />
Figure is its necessary medium of communication<br />
with man; for in the feebleness of ordinary words<br />
to express its ideas, and in the absence of terms of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_201_30" id="PgLn_201_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>abstract perfection, the adoption of metaphorical<br />
language is the only poor means allowed it for<br />
imparting to others its intense feelings. A metrical<br />
garb has, in all languages, been appropriated to<br />
poetry&mdash;it is but the outward development of<br />
the music and harmony within. The verse, far<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_202_5" id="PgLn_202_5">{5}</a></span><br />
from being a restraint on the true poet, is the<br />
suitable index of his sense, and is adopted by his<br />
free and deliberate choice. We shall presently<br />
show the applicability of our doctrine to the<br />
various departments of poetical composition;<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_202_10" id="PgLn_202_10">{10}</a></span><br />
first, however, it will be right to volunteer an<br />
explanation which may save it from much<br />
misconception and objection. Let not our notion<br />
be thought arbitrarily to limit the number of<br />
poets, generally considered such. It will be<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_202_15" id="PgLn_202_15">{15}</a></span><br />
found to lower particular works, or parts of<br />
works, rather than the authors themselves;<br />
sometimes to disparage only the vehicle in which<br />
the poetry is conveyed. There is an ambiguity<br />
in the word "poetry," which is taken to signify<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_202_20" id="PgLn_202_20">{20}</a></span><br />
both the gift itself, and the written composition<br />
which is the result of it. Thus there is an<br />
apparent, but no real, contradiction in saying a poem<br />
may be but partially poetical; in some passages<br />
more so than in others; and sometimes not<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_202_25" id="PgLn_202_25">{25}</a></span><br />
poetical at all. We only maintain, not that the<br />
writers forfeit the name of poet who fail at times<br />
to answer to our requisitions, but that they are<br />
poets only so far forth, and inasmuch as they do<br />
answer to them. We may grant, for instance,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_202_30" id="PgLn_202_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>that the vulgarities of old Ph&oelig;nix in the ninth<br />
<i>Iliad</i>, or of the nurse of Orestes in the <i>Cho&euml;phor</i>,<br />
are in themselves unworthy of their respective<br />
authors, and refer them to the wantonness of<br />
exuberant genius; and yet maintain that the<br />
scenes in question contain much incidental poetry.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_203_5" id="PgLn_203_5"></a><a href="#Iliad">{5}</a></span><br />
Now and then the luster of the true metal catches<br />
the eye, redeeming whatever is unseemly and<br />
worthless in the rude ore; still the ore is not the<br />
metal. Nay, sometimes, and not unfrequently in<br />
Shakspeare, the introduction of unpoetical<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_203_10" id="PgLn_203_10">{10}</a></span><br />
matter may be necessary for the sake of relief, or as<br />
a vivid expression of recondite conceptions, and,<br />
as it were, to make friends with the reader's<br />
imagination. This necessity, however, cannot<br />
make the additions in themselves beautiful and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_203_15" id="PgLn_203_15">{15}</a></span><br />
pleasing. Sometimes, on the other hand, while<br />
we do not deny the incidental beauty of a poem,<br />
we are ashamed and indignant on witnessing the<br />
unworthy substance in which that beauty is<br />
embedded. This remark applies strongly to the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_203_20" id="PgLn_203_20">{20}</a></span><br />
immoral compositions to which Lord Byron<br />
devoted his last years.<br /></p></blockquote>

Empedocles wrote his physics in verse, and<br />
Oppian his history of animals. Neither were<br />
poets&mdash;the one was an historian of nature, the<br />
other a sort of biographer of brutes. Yet a poet<br />
may make natural history or philosophy the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_203_30" id="PgLn_203_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>material of his composition. But under his hands<br />
they are no longer a bare collection of facts or<br />
principles, but are painted with a meaning,<br />
beauty, and harmonious order not their own.<br />
Thomson has sometimes been commended for<br />
the novelty and minuteness of his remarks upon<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_204_5" id="PgLn_204_5">{5}</a></span><br />
nature. This is not the praise of a poet, whose<br />
office rather is to represent known phenomena in<br />
a new connection or medium. In <i>L'Allegro</i> and<br />
<i>Il Penseroso</i> the poetical magician invests the<br />
commonest scenes of a country life with the hues,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_204_10" id="PgLn_204_10">{10}</a></span><br />
first of a cheerful, then of a pensive imagination.<br />
It is the charm of the descriptive poetry of a<br />
religious mind, that nature is viewed in a moral<br />
connection. Ordinary writers, for instance,<br />
compare aged men to trees in autumn&mdash;a gifted<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_204_15" id="PgLn_204_15">{15}</a></span><br />

men.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Pastoral poetry is a description of<br />

the fault of coloring too highly; instead of<br />

<blockquote><p>2. The difference between poetical and<br />
historical <i>narrative</i> may be illustrated by the Tales<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>Founded on Facts, generally of a religious<br />
character, so common in the present day, which we<br />
must not be thought to approve, because we use<br />
them for our purpose. The author finds in the<br />
circumstances of the case many particulars too<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_205_5" id="PgLn_205_5">{5}</a></span><br />
trivial for public notice, or irrelevant to the main<br />
story, or partaking perhaps too much of the<br />
peculiarity of individual minds: these he omits.<br />
He finds connected events separated from each<br />
other by time or place, or a course of action<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_205_10" id="PgLn_205_10">{10}</a></span><br />
distributed among a multitude of agents; he limits<br />
the scene or duration of the tale, and dispenses<br />
with his host of characters by condensing the<br />
mass of incident and action in the history of a<br />
few. He compresses long controversies into a<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_205_15" id="PgLn_205_15">{15}</a></span><br />
concise argument, and exhibits characters by<br />
dialogue, and (if such be his object) brings<br />
prominently forward the course of Divine<br />
Providence by a fit disposition of his materials. Thus<br />
he selects, combines, refines, colors&mdash;in fact,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_205_20" id="PgLn_205_20">{20}</a></span><br />
poetizes. His facts are no longer actual, but<br />
ideal; a tale founded on facts is a tale generalized<br />
from facts. The authors of <i>Peveril of the Peak</i>,<br />
and of <i>Brambletye House</i>, have given us their<br />
respective descriptions of the profligate times of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_205_25" id="PgLn_205_25">{25}</a></span><br />
Charles II. Both accounts are interesting, but<br />
for different reasons. That of the latter writer<br />
has the fidelity of history; Walter Scott's<br />
picture is the hideous reality, unintentionally softened<br />
and decorated by the poetry of his own mind.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_205_30" id="PgLn_205_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>Miss Edgeworth sometimes apologizes for certain<br />
incident in her tales by stating they took place<br />
"by one of those strange chances which occur in<br />
life, but seem incredible when found in writing."<br />
Such an excuse evinces a misconception of the<br />
principle of fiction, which, being the perfection of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_206_5" id="PgLn_206_5">{5}</a></span><br />
the actual, prohibits the introduction of any such<br />
anomalies of experience. It is by a similar<br />
impropriety that painters sometimes introduce<br />
unusual sunsets, or other singular phenomena of<br />
lights and forms. Yet some of Miss Edgeworth's<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_206_10" id="PgLn_206_10">{10}</a></span><br />
works contain much poetry of narrative.<br />
Maneuvering is perfect in its way,&mdash;the plot and<br />
characters are natural, without being too real to be<br />
pleasing.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>3. <i>Character</i> is made poetical by a like process.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_206_15" id="PgLn_206_15">{15}</a></span><br />
The writer draws indeed from experience; but<br />
unnatural peculiarities are laid aside, and harsh<br />
contrasts reconciled. If it be said the fidelity<br />
of the imitation is often its greatest merit, we<br />
have only to reply, that in such cases the pleasure<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_206_20" id="PgLn_206_20">{20}</a></span><br />
is not poetical, but consists in the mere<br />
recognition. All novels and tales which introduce real<br />
characters are in the same degree unpoetical.<br />
Portrait painting, to be poetical, should furnish<br />
an abstract representation of an individual; the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_206_25" id="PgLn_206_25">{25}</a></span><br />
abstraction being more rigid, inasmuch as the<br />
painting is confined to one point of time. The<br />
artist should draw independently of the accidents<br />
of attitude, dress, occasional feeling, and transient<br />
action. He should depict the general spirit of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_206_30" id="PgLn_206_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>his subject&mdash;as if he were copying from memory,<br />
not from a few particular sittings. An ordinary<br />
painter will delineate with rigid fidelity, and will<br />
make a caricature; but the learned artist<br />
contrives so to temper his composition, as to sink all<br />
offensive peculiarities and hardnesses of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_207_5" id="PgLn_207_5">{5}</a></span><br />
individuality, without diminishing the striking effect of<br />
the likeness, or acquainting the casual spectator<br />
with the secret of his art. Miss Edgeworth's<br />
representations of the Irish character are actual, and<br />
not poetical&mdash;nor were they intended to be so.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_207_10" id="PgLn_207_10">{10}</a></span><br />
They are interesting, because they are faithful.<br />
If there is poetry about them, it exists in the<br />
personages themselves, not in her representation<br />
of them. She is only the accurate reporter in<br />
word of what was poetical in fact. Hence,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_207_15" id="PgLn_207_15">{15}</a></span><br />
moreover, when a deed or incident is striking in itself,<br />
a judicious writer is led to describe it in the most<br />
simple and colorless terms, his own being<br />
unnecessary; for instance, if the greatness of the action<br />
itself excites the imagination, or the depth of the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_207_20" id="PgLn_207_20">{20}</a></span><br />
suffering interests the feelings. In the usual<br />
phrase, the circumstances are left "to speak for<br />
themselves."<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Let it not be said that our doctrine is adverse<br />
to that individuality in the delineation of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_207_25" id="PgLn_207_25">{25}</a></span><br />
character, which is a principal charm of fiction. It is<br />
not necessary for the ideality of a composition to<br />
avoid those minuter shades of difference between<br />
man and man, which give to poetry its<br />
plausibility and life; but merely such violation of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_207_30" id="PgLn_207_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>general nature, such improbabilities, wanderings, or<br />
coarseness, as interfere with the refined and<br />
delicate enjoyment of the imagination; which would<br />
have the elements of beauty extracted out of<br />
the confused multitude of ordinary actions and<br />
habits, and combined with consistency and ease.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_208_5" id="PgLn_208_5">{5}</a></span><br />
Nor does it exclude the introduction of imperfect<br />
or odious characters. The original conception of<br />
a weak or guilty mind may have its intrinsic<br />
beauty; and much more so, when it is connected<br />
with a tale which finally adjusts whatever is<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_208_10" id="PgLn_208_10">{10}</a></span><br />
reprehensible in the personages themselves.<br />
Richard and Iago are subservient to the plot.<br />
Moral excellence in some characters may become<br />
even a fault. The Clytemnestra of Euripides is<br />
so interesting, that the Divine vengeance, which<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_208_15" id="PgLn_208_15"></a><a href="#The_Divine_vengeance">{15}</a></span><br />
is the main subject of the drama, seems almost<br />
unjust. Lady Macbeth, on the contrary, is the<br />
conception of one deeply learned in the poetical<br />
art. She is polluted with the most heinous crimes,<br />
and meets the fate she deserves. Yet there is<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_208_20" id="PgLn_208_20">{20}</a></span><br />
nothing in the picture to offend the taste, and<br />
much to feed the imagination. Romeo and<br />
Juliet are too good for the termination to which<br />
the plot leads; so are Ophelia and the Bride of<br />
Lammermoor. In these cases there is something<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_208_25" id="PgLn_208_25">{25}</a></span><br />
inconsistent with correct beauty, and therefore<br />
unpoetical. We do not say the fault could be<br />
avoided without sacrificing more than would be<br />
gained; still it is a fault. It is scarcely possible<br />
for a poet satisfactorily to connect innocence with<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_208_30" id="PgLn_208_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>ultimate unhappiness, when the notion of a future<br />
life is excluded. Honors paid to the memory of<br />
the dead are some alleviation of the harshness.<br />
In his use of the doctrine of a future life, Southey<br />
is admirable. Other writers are content to<br />
conduct their heroes to temporal happiness;<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_209_5" id="PgLn_209_5">{5}</a></span><br />
Southey refuses present comfort to his Ladurlad,<br />
Thalaba, and Roderick, but carries them on<br />
through suffering to another world. The death<br />
of his hero is the termination of the action; yet<br />
so little in two of them, at least, does this<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_209_10" id="PgLn_209_10">{10}</a></span><br />
catastrophe excite sorrowful feelings, that some<br />
readers may be startled to be reminded of the<br />
fact. If a melancholy is thrown over the<br />
conclusion of the <i>Roderick</i>, it is from the peculiarities<br />
of the hero's previous history.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_209_15" id="PgLn_209_15">{15}</a></span><br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>4. Opinions, feelings, manners, and customs<br />
are made poetical by the delicacy or splendor<br />
with which they are expressed. This is seen in<br />
the <i>ode</i>, <i>elegy</i>, <i>sonnet</i>, and <i>ballad</i>, in which a<br />
single idea, perhaps, or familiar occurrence, is<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_209_20" id="PgLn_209_20">{20}</a></span><br />
invested by the poet with pathos or dignity. The<br />
ballad of <i>Old Robin Gray</i> will serve for an instance<br />
out of a multitude; again, Lord Byron's <i>Hebrew<br />
Melody</i>, beginning, "Were my bosom as false,"<br />
etc.; or Cowper's <i>Lines on his Mother's Picture</i>;<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_209_25" id="PgLn_209_25">{25}</a></span><br />
or Milman's <i>Funeral Hymn</i> in the Martyr of<br />
Antioch; or Milton's <i>Sonnet on his Blindness</i>; or<br />
Bernard Barton's <i>Dream</i>. As picturesque<br />
specimens, we may name Campbell's <i>Battle of the<br />
Baltic</i>; or Joanna Baillie's <i>Chough and Crow</i>;<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_209_30" id="PgLn_209_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>and for the more exalted and splendid style,<br />
Gray's <i>Bard</i>; or Milton's <i>Hymn on the Nativity</i>;<br />
in which facts, with which every one is familiar,<br />
are made new by the coloring of a poetical<br />
imagination. It must all along be observed, that<br />
we are not adducing instances for their own sake;<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_210_5" id="PgLn_210_5">{5}</a></span><br />
but in order to illustrate our general doctrine, and<br />
to show its applicability to those compositions<br />
which are, by universal consent, acknowledged to<br />
be poetical.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The department of poetry we are now speaking<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_210_10" id="PgLn_210_10">{10}</a></span><br />
of is of much wider extent than might at first<br />
sight appear. It will include such moralizing and<br />
philosophical poems as Young's <i>Night Thoughts</i>,<br />
and Byron's <i>Childe Harold</i>. There is much bad<br />
taste, at present, in the judgment passed on<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_210_15" id="PgLn_210_15"></a><a href="#Eloquence_mistaken_for_poetry">{15}</a></span><br />
compositions of this kind. It is the fault of the day<br />
to mistake mere eloquence for poetry; whereas,<br />
in direct opposition to the conciseness and<br />
simplicity of the poet, the talent of the orator consists<br />
in making much of a single idea. "Sic dicet ille ut<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_210_20" id="PgLn_210_20">{20}</a></span><br />
verset spe multis modis eandem et unam rem,<br />
ut hreat in e&acirc;dem commoreturque sententi&acirc;."<br />
This is the great art of Cicero himself, who,<br />
whether he is engaged in statement, argument, or<br />
raillery, never ceases till he has exhausted the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_210_25" id="PgLn_210_25">{25}</a></span><br />
subject; going round about it, and placing it in every<br />
different light, yet without repetition to offend or<br />
weary the reader. This faculty seems to consist<br />
in the power of throwing off harmonious verses,<br />
which, while they have a respectable portion of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_210_30" id="PgLn_210_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>meaning, yet are especially intended to charm the<br />
ear. In popular poems, common ideas are<br />
unfolded with copiousness, and set off in polished<br />
verse&mdash;and this is called poetry. Such is the<br />
character of Campbell's <i>Pleasures of Hope</i>; it is<br />
in his minor poems that the author's poetical<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_211_5" id="PgLn_211_5">{5}</a></span><br />
genius rises to its natural elevation. In <i>Childe<br />
Harold</i>, too, the writer is carried through his<br />
Spenserian stanza with the unweariness and<br />
equable fullness of accomplished eloquence;<br />
opening, illustrating, and heightening one idea, before<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_211_10" id="PgLn_211_10">{10}</a></span><br />
he passes on to another. His composition is an<br />
extended funeral sermon over buried joys and<br />
pleasures. His laments over Greece, Rome, and<br />
the fallen in various engagements, have quite the<br />
character of panegyrical orations; while by the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_211_15" id="PgLn_211_15">{15}</a></span><br />
very attempt to describe the celebrated buildings<br />
and sculptures of antiquity, he seems to confess<br />
that <i>they</i> are the poetical text, his the rhetorical<br />
comment. Still it is a work of splendid talent,<br />
though, as a whole, not of the highest poetical<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_211_20" id="PgLn_211_20">{20}</a></span><br />
excellence. Juvenal is perhaps the only ancient<br />
author who habitually substitutes declamation for<br />
poetry.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>5. The <i>philosophy of mind</i> may equally be made<br />
subservient to poetry, as the philosophy of nature.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_211_25" id="PgLn_211_25">{25}</a></span><br />
It is a common fault to mistake a mere knowledge<br />
of the heart for poetical talent. Our greatest<br />
masters have known better&mdash;they have<br />
subjected metaphysics to their art. In Hamlet,<br />
Macbeth, Richard, and Othello, the philosophy of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_211_30" id="PgLn_211_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>mind is but the material of the poet. These personages<br />
are ideal; they are effects of the contact<br />
of a given internal character with given outward<br />
circumstances, the results of combined conditions<br />
determining (so to say) a moral curve of original<br />
and inimitable properties. Philosophy is<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_212_5" id="PgLn_212_5">{5}</a></span><br />
exhibited in the same subserviency to poetry in<br />
many parts of Crabbe's <i>Tales of the Hall</i>. In the<br />
writings of this author there is much to offend a<br />
refined taste; but, at least in the work in question,<br />
there is much of a highly poetical cast. It is a<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_212_10" id="PgLn_212_10">{10}</a></span><br />
representation of the action and reaction of two<br />
minds upon each other and upon the world around<br />
them. Two brothers of different characters and<br />
fortunes, and strangers to each other, meet. Their<br />
habits of mind, the formation of those habits by<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_212_15" id="PgLn_212_15">{15}</a></span><br />
external circumstances, their respective media of<br />
judgment, their points of mutual attraction and<br />
repulsion, the mental position of each in relation<br />
to a variety of trifling phenomena of everyday<br />
nature and life, are beautifully developed in a<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_212_20" id="PgLn_212_20">{20}</a></span><br />
series of tales molded into a connected narrative.<br />
We are tempted to single out the fourth book,<br />
which gives an account of the childhood and<br />
education of the younger brother, and which for<br />
variety of thought as well as fidelity of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_212_25" id="PgLn_212_25">{25}</a></span><br />
description is in our judgment beyond praise. The<br />
Waverley Novels would afford us specimens of a<br />
similar excellence. One striking peculiarity of<br />
these tales is the author's practice of describing<br />
a group of characters bearing the same general<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_212_30" id="PgLn_212_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>features of mind, and placed in the same general<br />
circumstances; yet so contrasted with each other<br />
in minute differences of mental constitution, that<br />
each diverges from the common starting point into<br />
a path peculiar to himself. The brotherhood of<br />
villains in <i>Kenilworth</i>, of knights in <i>Ivanhoe</i>,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_213_5" id="PgLn_213_5">{5}</a></span><br />
and of enthusiasts in <i>Old Mortality</i> are instances<br />
of this. This bearing of character and plot on<br />
each other is not often found in Byron's poems.<br />
The Corsair is intended for a remarkable<br />
personage. We pass by the inconsistencies of his<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_213_10" id="PgLn_213_10">{10}</a></span><br />
character, considered by itself. The grand fault is,<br />
that whether it be natural or not, we are obliged<br />
to accept the author's word for the fidelity of his<br />
portrait. We are told, not shown, what the hero<br />
was. There is nothing in the plot which results<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_213_15" id="PgLn_213_15">{15}</a></span><br />
from his peculiar formation of mind. An<br />
everyday bravo might equally well have satisfied the<br />
requirements of the action. Childe Harold, again,<br />
if he is anything, is a being professedly isolated<br />
from the world, and uninfluenced by it. One<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_213_20" id="PgLn_213_20">{20}</a></span><br />
might as well draw Tityrus's stags grazing in the<br />
air, as a character of this kind; which yet, with<br />
more or less alteration, passes through successive<br />
editions in his other poems. Byron had very<br />
little versatility or elasticity of genius; he did not<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_213_25" id="PgLn_213_25">{25}</a></span><br />
know how to make poetry out of existing materials.<br />
He declaims in his own way, and has the<br />
upper-hand as long as he is allowed to go on; but, if<br />
interrogated on principles of nature and good<br />
sense, he is at once put out and brought to a<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_213_30" id="PgLn_213_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>stand.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Yet his conception of Sardanapalus and Myrrha<br />
is fine and ideal, and in the style of excellence<br />
which we have just been admiring in Shakspeare<br />

<blockquote><p>These illustrations of Aristotle's doctrine may<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_214_5" id="PgLn_214_5">{5}</a></span><br />
suffice.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Now let us proceed to a fresh position; which,<br />
as before, shall first be broadly stated, then<br />
modified and explained. How does originality<br />
differ from the poetical talent? Without<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_214_10" id="PgLn_214_10">{10}</a></span><br />
affecting the accuracy of a definition, we may call the<br />
latter the originality of right moral feeling.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Originality may perhaps be defined the power<br />
of abstracting for one's self, and is in thought<br />
what strength of mind is in action. Our opinions<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_214_15" id="PgLn_214_15">{15}</a></span><br />
are commonly derived from education and society.<br />
Common minds transmit as they receive, good and<br />
bad, true and false; minds of original talent feel a<br />
continual propensity to investigate subjects, and<br />
strike out views for themselves, so that even old<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_214_20" id="PgLn_214_20">{20}</a></span><br />
and established truths do not escape<br />
modification and accidental change when subjected to this<br />
process of mental digestion. Even the style of<br />
original writers is stamped with the peculiarities<br />
of their minds. When originality is found apart<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_214_25" id="PgLn_214_25">{25}</a></span><br />
from good sense, which more or less is frequently<br />
the case, it shows itself in paradox and rashness<br />
of sentiment, and eccentricity of outward conduct.<br />
Poetry, on the other hand, cannot be separated<br />
from its good sense, or taste, as it is called, which<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_214_30" id="PgLn_214_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>is one of its elements. It is originality energizing<br />
in the world of beauty; the originality of grace,<br />
purity, refinement, and good feeling. We do not<br />
hesitate to say, that poetry is ultimately founded<br />
on correct moral perception; that where there is<br />
no sound principle in exercise there will be no<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_215_5" id="PgLn_215_5">{5}</a></span><br />
poetry; and that on the whole (originality being<br />
granted) in proportion to the standard of a writer's<br />
moral character will his compositions vary in<br />
poetical excellence. This position, however,<br />
requires some explanation.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_215_10" id="PgLn_215_10">{10}</a></span><br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Of course, then, we do not mean to imply that<br />
a poet must necessarily display virtuous and<br />
religious feeling; we are not speaking of the actual<br />
material of poetry, but of its sources. A right<br />
moral state of heart is the formal and scientific<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_215_15" id="PgLn_215_15"></a><a href="#Conditions_of_the_poetical_mind">{15}</a></span><br />
condition of a poetical mind. Nor does it follow<br />
from our position that every poet must in fact be<br />
a man of consistent and practical principle;<br />
except so far as good feeling commonly produces or<br />
results from good practice. Burns was a man of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_215_20" id="PgLn_215_20">{20}</a></span><br />
inconsistent life; still, it is known, of much really<br />
sound principle at bottom. Thus his acknowledged<br />
poetical talent is in no wise inconsistent with<br />
the truth of our doctrine, which will refer the<br />
beauty which exists in his compositions to the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_215_25" id="PgLn_215_25">{25}</a></span><br />
remains of a virtuous and diviner nature within<br />
him. Nay, further than this, our theory holds<br />
good, even though it be shown that a depraved<br />
man may write a poem. As motives short of the<br />
purest lead to actions intrinsically good, so frames<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_215_30" id="PgLn_215_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>of mind short of virtuous will produce a partial<br />
and limited poetry. But even where this is<br />
instanced, the poetry of a vicious mind will be<br />
inconsistent and debased; that is, so far only poetry<br />
as the traces and shadows of holy truth still<br />
remain upon it. On the other hand, a right moral<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_216_5" id="PgLn_216_5">{5}</a></span><br />
feeling places the mind in the very center of that<br />
circle from which all the rays have their origin<br />
and range; whereas minds otherwise placed<br />
command but a portion of the whole circuit of poetry.<br />
Allowing for human infirmity and the varieties of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_216_10" id="PgLn_216_10">{10}</a></span><br />
opinion, Milton, Spenser, Cowper, Wordsworth,<br />
and Southey may be considered, as far as their<br />
writings go, to approximate to this moral center.<br />
The following are added as further illustrations of<br />
our meaning. Walter Scott's center is chivalrous<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_216_15" id="PgLn_216_15">{15}</a></span><br />
honor; Shakspeare exhibits the characteristics of<br />
an unlearned and undisciplined piety; Homer the<br />
religion of nature and conscience, at times debased<br />
by polytheism. All these poets are religious. The<br />
occasional irreligion of Virgil's poetry is painful<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_216_20" id="PgLn_216_20">{20}</a></span><br />
to the admirers of his general taste and delicacy.<br />
Dryden's <i>Alexander's Feast</i> is a magnificent<br />
composition, and has high poetical beauties; but to a<br />
refined judgment there is something intrinsically<br />
unpoetical in the end to which it is devoted, the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_216_25" id="PgLn_216_25">{25}</a></span><br />
praises of revel and sensuality. It corresponds to<br />
a process of clever reasoning erected on an untrue<br />
foundation&mdash;the one is a fallacy, the other is out<br />
of taste. Lord Byron's <i>Manfred</i> is in parts<br />
intensely poetical; yet the delicate mind naturally<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_216_30" id="PgLn_216_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>shrinks from the spirit which here and there reveals<br />
itself, and the basis on which the drama is<br />
built. From a perusal of it we should infer,<br />
according to the above theory, that there was right<br />
and fine feeling in the poet's mind, but that the<br />
central and consistent character was wanting.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_217_5" id="PgLn_217_5">{5}</a></span><br />
From the history of his life we know this to be<br />
the fact. The connection between want of the<br />
religious principle and want of poetical feeling is<br />
seen in the instances of Hume and Gibbon, who<br />
had radically unpoetical minds. Rousseau, it<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_217_10" id="PgLn_217_10">{10}</a></span><br />
may be supposed, is an exception to our doctrine.<br />
Lucretius, too, had great poetical genius; but his<br />
work evinces that his miserable philosophy was<br />
rather the result of a bewildered judgment than<br />
a corrupt heart.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_217_15" id="PgLn_217_15">{15}</a></span><br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>According to the above theory, Revealed<br />
Religion should be especially poetical&mdash;and it is so<br />
in fact. While its disclosures have an originality<br />
in them to engage the intellect, they have a beauty<br />
to satisfy the moral nature. It presents us with<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_217_20" id="PgLn_217_20">{20}</a></span><br />
those ideal forms of excellence in which a poetical<br />

sublimest views, and the tenderest and purest<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_217_25" id="PgLn_217_25">{25}</a></span><br />
feelings. The peculiar grace of mind of the New<br />

produced upon the hearts of those who have<br />
imbibed their spirit. At present we are not<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>of revealed truth. With Christians, a poetical<br />
view of things is a duty&mdash;we are bid to color all<br />
things with hues of faith, to see a Divine meaning<br />
in every event, and a superhuman tendency. Even<br />
our friends around are invested with unearthly<br />
brightness&mdash;no longer imperfect men, but beings<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_218_5" id="PgLn_218_5">{5}</a></span><br />
taken into Divine favor, stamped with His seal,<br />
and in training for future happiness. It may be<br />
added, that the virtues peculiarly Christian are<br />
especially poetical&mdash;meekness, gentleness,<br />
compassion, contentment, modesty, not to mention<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_218_10" id="PgLn_218_10">{10}</a></span><br />
the devotional virtues; whereas the ruder and<br />
more ordinary feelings are the instruments of<br />
rhetoric more justly than of poetry&mdash;anger,<br />
indignation, emulation, martial spirit, and love of<br />
independence.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_218_15" id="PgLn_218_15">{15}</a></span><br /></p></blockquote>

possible with God. He who could walk the waters,<br />
could also ride triumphantly upon what is still<br />
more fickle, unstable, tumultuous,<br />
treacherous&mdash;the billows of human wills, human purposes,<br />
human hearts. The bark of Peter was struggling<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_223_10" id="PgLn_223_10">{10}</a></span><br />
with the waves, and made no progress; Christ<br />
came to him walking upon them; He entered the<br />
boat, and by entering it He sustained it. He did<br />
not abandon Himself to it, but He brought it<br />
near to Himself; He did not merely take refuge<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_223_15" id="PgLn_223_15">{15}</a></span><br />
in it, but He made Himself the strength of it,<br />
and the pledge and cause of a successful passage.<br />

gospel was first preached to them; and from<br />

of holy pastors, with miter and crosier and<br />

a joyful people. The crucifix headed the<br />
procession, and simple monks were there with hearts in<br />
prayer, and sweet chants resounded, and the holy<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_228_10" id="PgLn_228_10">{10}</a></span><br />

as wonderful as any which the astronomer notes<br />

here for centuries&mdash;at least in the judgments<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_234_5" id="PgLn_234_5">{5}</a></span><br />
and intentions of men, if not in act and deed.<br />
We should note it down, that soon after St.<br />
Michael's day, 1850, a storm arose in the moral<br />
world, so furious as to demand some great<br />
explanation, and to rouse in us an intense desire to<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_234_10" id="PgLn_234_10">{10}</a></span><br />
gain it. We should observe it increasing from<br />
day to day, and spreading from place to place,<br />
without remission, almost without lull, up to this<br />
very hour, when perhaps it threatens worse still,<br />
or at least gives no sure prospect of alleviation.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_234_15" id="PgLn_234_15">{15}</a></span><br />
Every party in the body politic undergoes its<br />

religious societies and associations, the great body<br />
of established clergy in town and country, the bar,<br />
even the medical profession, nay, even literary<br />

interest, every fireside, gives tokens of this<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_234_25" id="PgLn_234_25">{25}</a></span><br />
ubiquitous storm. This would be our report of it, seeing<br />
it from the distance, and we should speculate<br />
on the cause. What is it all about? against what<br />
is it directed? what wonder has happened upon<br />
earth? what prodigious, what preternatural event<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_234_30" id="PgLn_234_30">{30}</a></span><br />

<blockquote><p>We should judge rightly in our curiosity about<br />
a phenomenon like this; it must be a portentous<br />
event, and it is. It is an innovation, a miracle,<br />
I may say, in the course of human events. The<br />
physical world revolves year by year, and begins<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_235_5" id="PgLn_235_5">{5}</a></span><br />
again; but the political order of things does not<br />
renew itself, does not return; it continues, but it<br />
proceeds; there is no retrogression. This is so<br />
well understood by men of the day, that with<br />
them progress is idolized as another name for<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_235_10" id="PgLn_235_10">{10}</a></span><br />
good. The past never returns&mdash;it is never good;<br />
if we are to escape existing ills, it must be by<br />
going forward. The past is out of date; the past<br />
is dead. As well may the dead live to us, as well<br />
may the dead profit us, as the past return. <i>This</i>,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_235_15" id="PgLn_235_15">{15}</a></span><br />
then, is the cause of this national transport, this<br />
national cry, which encompasses us. The past <i>has</i><br />
returned, the dead lives. Thrones are overturned,<br />
and are never restored; States live and die, and<br />
then are matter only for history. Babylon was<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_235_20" id="PgLn_235_20"></a><a href="#The_English_Church">{20}</a></span><br />
great, and Tyre, and Egypt, and Nineveh, and<br />
shall never be great again. The English Church<br />
was, and the English Church was not, and the<br />
English Church is once again. This is the<br />
portent, worthy of a cry. It is the coming in of a<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_235_25" id="PgLn_235_25">{25}</a></span><br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>land in pride of place. It had the honors of near<br />
a thousand years upon it; it was enthroned on<br />
some twenty sees up and down the broad country;<br />
it was based in the will of a faithful people;<br />
it energized through ten thousand instruments of<br />
power and influence; and it was ennobled by a<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_236_5" id="PgLn_236_5">{5}</a></span><br />
host of Saints and Martyrs. The churches, one<br />

Brothers&mdash;you know it well. I need not go through it. The<br />
vivifying principle of truth, the shadow of St.<br />

old Church in its day became a corpse (a<br />

corrupt the air which once it refreshed, and<br />
cumber the ground which once it beautified. So all<br />
seemed to be lost; and there was a struggle for<br />
a time, and then its priests were cast out or<br />
martyred. There were sacrileges innumerable.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_237_15" id="PgLn_237_15">{15}</a></span><br />
Its temples were profaned or destroyed; its<br />
revenues seized by covetous nobles, or squandered<br />
upon the ministers of a new faith. The presence<br />

removed,&mdash;its grace disowned,&mdash;its power despised,&mdash;its<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_237_20" id="PgLn_237_20">{20}</a></span><br />
name, except as a matter of history, at length<br />
almost unknown. It took a long time to do this<br />
thoroughly; much time, much thought, much<br />
labor, much expense; but at last it was done.<br />
Oh, that miserable day, centuries before we were<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_237_25" id="PgLn_237_25">{25}</a></span><br />
born! What a martyrdom to live in it and see<br />
the fair form of Truth, moral and material,<br />
hacked piecemeal, and every limb and organ<br />
carried off, and burned in the fire, or cast into<br />
the deep! But at last the work was done. Truth<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_237_30" id="PgLn_237_30">{30}</a></span><br />

was about the state of things when we were born<br />
into this weary world.<br /></p></blockquote>

one side, and some of us on another; but one and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_238_5" id="PgLn_238_5">{5}</a></span><br />
all of us can bear witness to the fact of the utter<br />
contempt into which Catholicism had fallen by<br />
the time that we were born. You, alas, know it<br />
far better than I can know it; but it may not be<br />
out of place, if by one or two tokens, as by the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_238_10" id="PgLn_238_10">{10}</a></span><br />
strokes of a pencil, I bear witness to you from<br />
without, of what you can witness so much more<br />
truly from within. No longer the Catholic<br />
Church in the country; nay, no longer, I may<br />
say, a Catholic community; but a few<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_238_15" id="PgLn_238_15">{15}</a></span><br />
adherents of the Old Religion, moving silently<br />
and sorrowfully about, as memorials of what had<br />
been. The "Roman Catholics,"&mdash;not a sect,<br />
not even an interest, as men conceived of<br />
it,&mdash;not a body, however small, representative of the <span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_238_20" id="PgLn_238_20">{20}</a></span><br />
Great Communion abroad,&mdash;but a mere handful<br />
of individuals, who might be counted, like the<br />
pebbles and <i>detritus</i> of the great deluge, and<br />
who, forsooth, merely happened to retain a creed<br />
which, in its day indeed, was the profession of a<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_238_25" id="PgLn_238_25">{25}</a></span><br />
Church. Here a set of poor Irishmen, coming and<br />
going at harvest time, or a colony of them lodged<br />
in a miserable quarter of the vast metropolis.<br />
There, perhaps an elderly person, seen walking<br />
in the streets, grave and solitary, and strange,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_238_30" id="PgLn_238_30">{30}</a></span><br />

family, and a "Roman Catholic." An<br />
old-fashioned house of gloomy appearance, closed in<br />
with high walls, with an iron gate, and yews, and<br />
the report attaching to it that "Roman Catholics"<br />
lived there; but who they were, or what they did,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_239_5" id="PgLn_239_5">{5}</a></span><br />
or what was meant by calling them Roman<br />
Catholics, no one could tell&mdash;though it had an<br />
unpleasant sound, and told of form and<br />
superstition. And then, perhaps, as we went to and fro,<br />
looking with a boy's curious eyes through the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_239_10" id="PgLn_239_10">{10}</a></span><br />
great city, we might come to-day upon some<br />
Moravian chapel, or Quaker's meeting-house, and<br />
to-morrow on a chapel of the "Roman Catholics";<br />
but nothing was to be gathered from it, except<br />
that there were lights burning there, and some<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_239_15" id="PgLn_239_15">{15}</a></span><br />
boys in white, swinging censers; and what it all<br />
meant could only be learned from books, from<br />
Protestant Histories and Sermons; and they did<br />
not report well of the "Roman Catholics," but,<br />
on the contrary, deposed that they had once had<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_239_20" id="PgLn_239_20">{20}</a></span><br />
power and had abused it. And then, again, we<br />
might on one occasion hear it pointedly put out<br />
by some literary man, as the result of his careful<br />
investigation, and as a recondite point of<br />
information, which few knew, that there was this<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_239_25" id="PgLn_239_25">{25}</a></span><br />
difference between the Roman Catholics of England<br />
and the Roman Catholics of Ireland, that the<br />
latter had bishops, and the former were governed<br />
by four officials, called Vicars-Apostolic.<br /></p></blockquote>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>of Christianity by the heathen of old time, who<br />
persecuted its adherents from the face of the<br />
earth, and then called them a <i>gens lucifuga</i>, a<br />
people who shunned the light of day. Such were<br />
Catholics in England, found in corners, and alleys,<br />
and cellars, and the housetops, or in the recesses<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_240_5" id="PgLn_240_5">{5}</a></span><br />
of the country; cut off from the populous world<br />
around them, and dimly seen, as if through a<br />

At length so feeble did they become, so utterly<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_240_10" id="PgLn_240_10">{10}</a></span><br />
contemptible, that contempt gave birth to pity;<br />

unbelief might be our plea for mercy.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>A <i>great</i> change, an <i>awful</i> contrast, between the<br />

that lordly power; but there was a greater and a<br />
truer one in store. No one could have prophesied<br />
its fall, but still less would any one have ventured<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>wonderful; still after all it was in the order of nature;<br />

be a different sort of wonder, for it is in the order<br />

such a miracle as this? Has the whole course of<br />
history a like to show? I must speak cautiously<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_241_5" id="PgLn_241_5">{5}</a></span><br />
and according to my knowledge, but I recollect<br />
no parallel to it. Augustine, indeed, came to<br />
the same island to which the early missionaries<br />
had come already; but they came to Britons, and<br />
he to Saxons. The Arian Goths and Lombards,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_241_10" id="PgLn_241_10"></a><a href="#Arian_Goths_and_Lombards">{10}</a></span><br />
too, cast off their heresy in St. Augustine's age,<br />
and joined the Church; but they had never fallen<br />
away from her. The inspired word seems to imply<br />
the almost impossibility of such a grace as the<br />
renovation of those who have crucified to<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_241_15" id="PgLn_241_15">{15}</a></span><br />
themselves again, and trodden under foot, the Son of<br />
God. Who then could have dared to hope that,<br />
out of so sacrilegious a nation as this is, a people<br />
would have been formed again unto their Saviour?<br />
What signs did it show that it was to be singled<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_241_20" id="PgLn_241_20">{20}</a></span><br />
out from among the nations? Had it been<br />
prophesied some fifty years ago, would not the<br />
very notion have seemed preposterous and wild?</p></blockquote>

that a day such as this, in which we stand, would<br />
have seemed to him a dream, or, if he prophesied<br />

that one time, rapt in spirit, he had reached<br />
forward to the future, and that his mortal eye had<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_242_10" id="PgLn_242_10">{10}</a></span><br />

him: "I see a bleak mount, looking upon an open<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_242_15" id="PgLn_242_15">{15}</a></span><br />

us the promise of this Spring. A second temple<br />

part with them. We clung to the vision of past<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_245_25" id="PgLn_245_25">{25}</a></span><br />
greatness, and would not believe it could come<br />
to naught; but the Church in England has died,<br />

at the beginning.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_246_5" id="PgLn_246_5">{5}</a></span><br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Yes, my Fathers and Brothers, and if it be<br />
God's blessed will, not Saints alone, not Doctors<br />

Martyrs, too, shall re-consecrate the soil to God.<br />
We know not what is before us, ere we win our<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_246_10" id="PgLn_246_10">{10}</a></span><br />
own; we are engaged in a great, a joyful work,<br />
but in proportion to God's grace is the fury of<br />
His enemies. They have welcomed us as the<br />
lion greets his prey. Perhaps they may be<br />
familiarized in time with our appearance, but<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_246_15" id="PgLn_246_15">{15}</a></span><br />
perhaps they may be irritated the more. To set<br />
up the Church again in England is too great an<br />
act to be done in a corner. We have had reason<br />
to expect that such a boon would not be given<br />
to us without a cross. It is not God's way that<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_246_20" id="PgLn_246_20">{20}</a></span><br />
great blessings should descend without the sacrifice<br />
first of great sufferings. If the truth is to be<br />
spread to any wide extent among this people, how<br />
can we dream, how can we hope, that trial and<br />
trouble shall not accompany its going forth? And<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_246_25" id="PgLn_246_25">{25}</a></span><br />
we have already, if it may be said without<br />
presumption, to commence our work withal, a large<br />
store of merits. We have no slight outfit for our<br />
opening warfare. Can we religiously suppose that<br />
the blood of our martyrs, three centuries ago and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_246_30" id="PgLn_246_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>since, shall never receive its recompense? Those<br />
priests, secular and regular, did they suffer for<br />
no end? or rather, for an end which is not yet<br />
accomplished? The long imprisonment, the fetid<br />
dungeon, the weary suspense, the tyrannous trial,<br />
the barbarous sentence, the savage execution, the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_247_5" id="PgLn_247_5"></a><a href="#Regular_and_secular_priests">{5}</a></span><br />
rack, the gibbet, the knife, the caldron, the<br />
numberless tortures of those holy victims, O my God,<br />
are they to have no reward? Are Thy martyrs<br />
to cry from under Thine altar for their loving<br />
vengeance on this guilty people, and to cry in<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_247_10" id="PgLn_247_10">{10}</a></span><br />
vain? Shall they lose life, and not gain a<br />
better life for the children of those who persecuted<br />
them? Is this Thy way, O my God, righteous<br />
and true? Is it according to Thy promise, O<br />
King of Saints, if I may dare talk to Thee of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_247_15" id="PgLn_247_15"></a><a href="#Thy_first_Martyr">{15}</a></span><br />
justice? Did not Thou Thyself pray for Thine<br />
enemies upon the cross, and convert them? Did<br />
not Thy first Martyr win Thy great Apostle, then<br />
a persecutor, by his loving prayer? And in that<br />
day of trial and desolation for England, when<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_247_20" id="PgLn_247_20">{20}</a></span><br />
hearts were pierced through and through with<br />
Mary's woe, at the crucifixion of Thy body<br />
mystical, was not every tear that flowed, and<br />
every drop of blood that was shed, the seeds of a<br />
future harvest, when they who sowed in sorrow<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_247_25" id="PgLn_247_25">{25}</a></span><br />
were to reap in joy?<br /></p></blockquote>

recompensed, so, perchance, it is not yet<br />
exhausted. Something, for what we know, remains<br />

and my Brothers, if the winter even now should<br />
not yet be quite over? Have we any right to<br />
take it strange, if, in this English land, the<br />
spring-time of the Church should turn out to be an<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_248_5" id="PgLn_248_5">{5}</a></span><br />

Mother Mary, and our good Patrons and Angel<br />
Guardians; the more malicious are the devices of<br />
men against us, the louder cry of supplication will<br />
ascend from the bosom of the whole Church to<br />
God for us. We shall not be left orphans; we<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_248_20" id="PgLn_248_20"></a><a href="#Orphans">{20}</a></span><br />

become a martyr for His sake. I do not say you<br />

away; I do not speak of what you can do by any<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_248_30" id="PgLn_248_30">{30}</a></span><br />

in the grace of the Spirit, in the armor of justice,<br />
by the consolations and peace of the Church, by<br />
the blessing of the Apostles Peter and Paul, and<br />
in the name of Christ, you would do what nature<br />
cannot do. By the intercession of the Saints on<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_249_5" id="PgLn_249_5">{5}</a></span><br />
high, by the penances and good works and the<br />
prayers of the people of God on earth, you would<br />
be forcibly borne up as upon the waves of the<br />
mighty deep, and carried on out of yourselves by<br />
the fullness of grace, whether nature wished it or<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_249_10" id="PgLn_249_10">{10}</a></span><br />
no. I do not mean violently, or with unseemly<br />
struggle, but calmly, gracefully, sweetly, joyously,<br />
you would mount up and ride forth to the battle,<br />
as on the rush of Angels' wings, as your fathers<br />
did before you, and gained the prize. You, who<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_249_15" id="PgLn_249_15"></a><a href="#You_victim">{15}</a></span><br />
day by day offer up the Immaculate Lamb of<br />

<blockquote><p>My Fathers, my Brothers, one word more. It<br />
may seem as if I were going out of my way in<br />
thus addressing you; but I have some sort of<br />
plea to urge in extenuation. When the English<br />
College at Rome was set up by the solicitude of a<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_249_30" id="PgLn_249_30"></a><a href="#A_great_Pontiff">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>great Pontiff in the beginning of England's sorrows,<br />
and missionaries were trained there for<br />
confessorship and martyrdom here, who was it that<br />
saluted the fair Saxon youths as they passed by<br />
him in the streets of the great city, with the<br />
salutation, "Salvete flores martyrum"? And when<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_250_5" id="PgLn_250_5">{5}</a></span><br />
the time came for each in turn to leave that<br />
peaceful home, and to go forth to the conflict, to whom<br />
did they betake themselves before leaving Rome,<br />
to receive a blessing which might nerve them for<br />
their work? They went for a Saint's blessing;<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_250_10" id="PgLn_250_10">{10}</a></span><br />
they went to a calm old man, who had never<br />
seen blood, except in penance; who had longed<br />
indeed to die for Christ, what time the great St.<br />
Francis opened the way to the far East, but who<br />
had been fixed as if a sentinel in the holy city,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_250_15" id="PgLn_250_15"></a><a href="#St_Francis">{15}</a></span><br />
and walked up and down for fifty years on one<br />
beat, while his brethren were in the battle. Oh!<br />
the fire of that heart, too great for its frail<br />
tenement, which tormented him to be kept at home<br />
when the whole Church was at war! and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_250_20" id="PgLn_250_20">{20}</a></span><br />
therefore came those bright-haired strangers to him,<br />
ere they set out for the scene of their passion,<br />
that the full zeal and love pent up in that burning<br />
breast might find a vent, and flow over, from him<br />
who was kept at home, upon those who were to<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_250_25" id="PgLn_250_25">{25}</a></span><br />
face the foe. Therefore one by one, each in his<br />
turn, those youthful soldiers came to the old man;<br />
and one by one they persevered and gained the<br />
crown and the palm,&mdash;all but one, who had not<br />
gone, and would not go, for the salutary blessing.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_250_30" id="PgLn_250_30">{30}</a></span><br /></p></blockquote>

absorbed in the Divine life, that they seem, even<br />
while they are in the flesh, to have no part in<br />

simply supernatural. If they love others, it is<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_252_10" id="PgLn_252_10">{10}</a></span><br />
simply because they love God, and because man<br />
is the object either of His compassion, or of His<br />

them to the glory of the Giver; they do not act<br />
beside them, but through them; they do not<br />
eclipse them by the brightness of Divine grace,<br />

human knowledge; they are busy in human<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_253_5" id="PgLn_253_5">{5}</a></span><br />
society; they understand the human heart; they<br />

words, "I live, now not I, but Christ liveth in<br />
me; and, that I now live in the flesh, I live in the<br />

his most astonishing ecstasies and visions; as<br />
when he was rapt even to the third heaven, and<br />
heard sacred words, which it "is not granted to<br />
man to utter." You may say, he "no way came<br />
short" of St. John in his awful initiation into the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_255_10" id="PgLn_255_10">{10}</a></span><br />
mysteries of the kingdom of heaven. Certainly<br />
you may say so; nor am I imagining anything<br />
contrary to you. We indeed cannot compare<br />
Saints; but I agree with you, that St. Paul was<br />
visited by favors, equal, in our apprehensions, to<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_255_15" id="PgLn_255_15">{15}</a></span><br />
those which were granted to St. John. But then,<br />
on the other hand, neither was St. John behind<br />
St. Paul in these tokens of Divine love. In truth,<br />
these tokens are some of those very things which,<br />
in a greater or less degree, belong to all Saints<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_255_20" id="PgLn_255_20">{20}</a></span><br />
whatever, as I said when I began; whereas my<br />
question just now is, not what are those points in<br />
which St. Paul agrees with all other Saints, but<br />
what is his distinguished mark, how we recognize<br />
him from others, what there is special in him;<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_255_25" id="PgLn_255_25">{25}</a></span><br />
and I think his characteristic is this,&mdash;that, as I<br />
have said, in him the fullness of Divine gifts does<br />
not tend to destroy what is human in him, but to<br />
spiritualize and perfect it. According to his own<br />
words, used on another subject, but laying down,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_255_30" id="PgLn_255_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>as it were, the principle on which his own character<br />
was formed,&mdash;"We would not be<br />
<i>un</i>-clothed," he says, but "clothed <i>upon</i>, that what<br />
is mortal may be swallowed up by life." In him,<br />
his human nature, his human affections, his<br />
human gifts, were possessed and glorified by a new<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_256_5" id="PgLn_256_5">{5}</a></span><br />
and heavenly life; they remained; he speaks of<br />
them in the text, and in his humility he calls<br />
them his infirmity. He was not stripped of<br />
nature, but clothed with grace and the power of<br />
Christ, and therefore he <i>glories</i> in his infirmity.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_256_10" id="PgLn_256_10">{10}</a></span><br />
This is the subject on which I wish to enlarge.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>A heathen poet has said, Homo sum, humani<br />
nihil a me alienum puto. "I am a man; nothing<br />
human is without interest to me:" and the<br />
sentiment has been widely and deservedly praised.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_256_15" id="PgLn_256_15"></a><a href="#Heathen_poet">{15}</a></span><br />
Now this, in a fullness of meaning which a heathen<br />
could not understand, is, I conceive, the<br />
characteristic of this great Apostle. He is ever<br />
speaking, to use his own words, "human things," and<br />
"as a man," and "according to man," and<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_256_20" id="PgLn_256_20">{20}</a></span><br />
"foolishly"; that is, human nature, the<br />
common nature of the whole race of Adam, spoke in<br />
him, acted in him, with an energetical presence,<br />
with a sort of bodily fullness, always under the<br />
sovereign command of Divine grace, but losing<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_256_25" id="PgLn_256_25">{25}</a></span><br />
none of its real freedom and power because of<br />
its subordination. And the consequence is, that,<br />
having the nature of man so strong within him,<br />
he is able to enter into human nature, and to<br />
sympathize with it, with a gift peculiarly his own.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_256_30" id="PgLn_256_30">{30}</a></span><br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>Now the most startling instance of this is this,<br />
&mdash;that, though his life prior to his conversion<br />
seems to have been so conscientious and so pure,<br />
nevertheless he does not hesitate to associate<br />
himself with the outcast heathen, and to speak<br />
as if he were one of them. St. Philip Neri, before<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_257_5" id="PgLn_257_5"></a><a href="#St_Philip_Neri">{5}</a></span><br />
he communicated, used to say, "Lord, I protest<br />
before Thee that I am good for nothing but to<br />
do evil." At confession he used to say, "I have<br />
never done one good action." He often said, "I<br />
am past hope." To a penitent he said, "Be sure<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_257_10" id="PgLn_257_10">{10}</a></span><br />
of this, I am a man like my neighbors, and<br />
nothing more." Well, I mean, that somewhat in this<br />
way, St. Paul felt all his neighbors, all the whole<br />
race of Adam, to be existing in himself. He<br />
knew himself to be possessed of a nature, he was<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_257_15" id="PgLn_257_15">{15}</a></span><br />
conscious of possessing a nature, which was<br />
capable of running into all the multiplicity of<br />
emotions, of devices, of purposes, and of sins,<br />
into which it had actually run in the wide world<br />
and in the multitude of men; and in that sense<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_257_20" id="PgLn_257_20">{20}</a></span><br />
he bore the sins of all men, and associated<br />
himself with them, and spoke of them and himself<br />
as one. He, I say, a strict Pharisee (as he<br />
describes himself), blameless according to legal<br />
justice, conversing with all good conscience<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_257_25" id="PgLn_257_25">{25}</a></span><br />
before God, serving God from his forefathers with a<br />
pure conscience, he nevertheless elsewhere speaks<br />
of himself as a profligate heathen outcast before<br />
the grace of God called him. He not only counts<br />
himself, as his birth made him, in the number of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_257_30" id="PgLn_257_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>"children of wrath," but he classes himself with<br />
the heathen as "conversing in the desires of the<br />
flesh," "and fulfilling the will of the flesh." And<br />
in another Epistle, he speaks of himself, at the<br />
time he writes, as if "carnal, sold under sin";<br />
he speaks of "sin dwelling in him," and of his<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_258_5" id="PgLn_258_5">{5}</a></span><br />
"serving with the flesh the law of sin"; this, I<br />
say, when he was an Apostle confirmed in grace.<br />
And in like manner he speaks of concupiscence as<br />
if it were sin; all because he vividly apprehended,<br />
in that nature of his which grace had sanctified,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_258_10" id="PgLn_258_10">{10}</a></span><br />
what it was in its tendencies and results when<br />
deprived of grace.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>And thus I account for St. Paul's liking for<br />
heathen writers, or what we now call the classics,<br />
which is very remarkable. He, the Apostle of the<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_258_15" id="PgLn_258_15">{15}</a></span><br />
Gentiles, was learned in Greek letters, as Moses,<br />
the lawgiver of the Jews, his counterpart, was<br />
learned in the wisdom of the Egyptians; and he<br />
did not give up that learning when he had<br />
"learned Christ." I do not think I am<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_258_20" id="PgLn_258_20">{20}</a></span><br />
exaggerating in saying so, since he goes out of his way three<br />
times to quote passages from them; once,<br />
speaking to the heathen Athenians; another time, to<br />
his converts at Corinth; and a third time, in a<br />
private Apostolic exhortation to his disciple St.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_258_25" id="PgLn_258_25">{25}</a></span><br />
Titus. And it is the more remarkable, that one<br />
of the writers whom he quotes seems to be a<br />
writer of comedies, which had no claim to be read<br />
for any high morality which they contain. Now<br />
how shall we account for this? Did St. Paul<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_258_30" id="PgLn_258_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>delight in what was licentious? God forbid; but<br />
he had the feeling of a guardian-angel who sees<br />
every sin of the rebellious being committed to<br />
him, who gazes at him and weeps. With this<br />
difference, that he had a sympathy with sinners,<br />
which an Angel (be it reverently said) cannot<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_259_5" id="PgLn_259_5">{5}</a></span><br />
have. He was a true lover of souls. He loved<br />
poor human nature with a passionate love, and<br />
the literature of the Greeks was only its<br />
expression; and he hung over it tenderly and<br />
mournfully, wishing for its regeneration and salvation.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_259_10" id="PgLn_259_10">{10}</a></span><br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>This is how I account for his familiar<br />
knowledge of the heathen poets. Some of the ancient<br />
Fathers consider that the Greeks were under a<br />
special dispensation of Providence, preparatory<br />
to the Gospel, though not directly from heaven<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_259_15" id="PgLn_259_15">{15}</a></span><br />
as the Jewish was. Now St. Paul seems, if I may<br />
say it, to partake of this feeling; distinctly as he<br />
teaches that the heathen are in darkness, and in<br />
sin, and under the power of the Evil One, he will<br />
not allow that they are beyond the eye of Divine<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_259_20" id="PgLn_259_20">{20}</a></span><br />
Mercy. On the contrary, he speaks of God as<br />
"determining their times and the limits of their<br />
habitation," that is, going along with the<br />
revolutions of history and the migrations of races, "in<br />
order that they should seek Him, if haply they<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_259_25" id="PgLn_259_25"></a><a href="#Lycaonians">{25}</a></span><br />
may feel after Him and find Him," since, he<br />
continues, "He is not far from every one of us."<br />
Again, when the Lycaonians would have<br />
worshiped him, he at once places himself on their<br />
level and reckons himself among them, and at<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_259_30" id="PgLn_259_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>the same time speaks of God's love of them,<br />
heathens though they were. "Ye men," he cries,<br />
"why do ye these things? We also are mortals,<br />
men like unto you;" and he adds that God in<br />
times past, though suffering all nations to walk<br />
in their own ways, "nevertheless left not Himself<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_260_5" id="PgLn_260_5">{5}</a></span><br />
without testimony, doing good from heaven,<br />
giving rains and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts<br />
with food and gladness." You see, he says, "<i>our</i><br />
hearts," not "your," as if he were one of those<br />
Gentiles; and he dwells in a kindly human way<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_260_10" id="PgLn_260_10">{10}</a></span><br />
over the food, and the gladness which food causes,<br />
which the poor heathen were granted. Hence it<br />
is that he is the Apostle who especially insists on<br />
our all coming from one father, Adam; for he<br />
had pleasure in thinking that all men were<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_260_15" id="PgLn_260_15">{15}</a></span><br />
brethren. "God hath made," he says, "all<br />
mankind of one"; "as in Adam all die, so in Christ<br />
all shall be made alive." I will cite but one<br />
more passage from the great Apostle on the same<br />
subject, one in which he tenderly contemplates<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_260_20" id="PgLn_260_20">{20}</a></span><br />
the captivity, and the anguish, and the longing,<br />
and the deliverance of poor human nature. "The<br />
expectation of the creature," he says, that is, of<br />
human nature, "waiteth for the manifestation<br />
of the sons of God. For the creature was made<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_260_25" id="PgLn_260_25">{25}</a></span><br />
subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of<br />
Him that made it subject, in hope; because it<br />
shall be delivered from the servitude of<br />
corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children<br />
of God. For we know that every creature<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_260_30" id="PgLn_260_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>groaneth and travaileth in pain until now."<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>These are specimens of the tender affection<br />
which the great heart of the Apostle had for all<br />
his kind, the sons of Adam: but if he felt so much<br />
for all races spread over the earth, what did he<br />
feel for his own nation! O what a special<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_261_5" id="PgLn_261_5">{5}</a></span><br />
mixture, bitter and sweet, of generous pride (if I may<br />
so speak), but of piercing, overwhelming anguish,<br />
did the thought of the race of Israel inflict upon<br />
him! the highest of nations and the lowest, his<br />
own dear people, whose glories were before his<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_261_10" id="PgLn_261_10">{10}</a></span><br />
imagination and in his affection from his<br />
childhood, who had the birthright and the promise,<br />
yet who, instead of making use of them, had<br />
madly thrown them away! Alas, alas, and he<br />
himself had once been a partner in their madness,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_261_15" id="PgLn_261_15">{15}</a></span><br />
and was only saved from his infatuation by the<br />
miraculous power of God! O dearest ones, O<br />
glorious race, O miserably fallen! so great and so<br />
abject! This is his tone in speaking of the Jews,<br />
at once a Jeremias and a David; David in his<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_261_20" id="PgLn_261_20">{20}</a></span><br />
patriotic care for them, and Jeremias in his<br />
plaintive and resigned denunciations.<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Consider his words: "I speak the truth in<br />
Christ," he says; "I lie not, my conscience<br />
bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost; that I have<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_261_25" id="PgLn_261_25">{25}</a></span><br />
great sadness and continual sorrow in my heart."<br />
In spite of visions and ecstasies, in spite of his<br />
wonderful election, in spite of his manifold gifts,<br />
in spite of the cares of his Apostolate and "the<br />
solicitude for all the churches"&mdash;you would<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_261_30" id="PgLn_261_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>think he had had enough otherwise both to grieve<br />
him and to gladden him&mdash;but no, this special<br />
contemplation remains ever before his mind and in<br />
his heart. I mean, the state of his own poor<br />
people, who were in mad enmity against the<br />
promised Saviour, who had for centuries after<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_262_5" id="PgLn_262_5">{5}</a></span><br />
centuries looked forward for the Hope of Israel,<br />
prepared the way for it, heralded it, suffered for<br />
it, cherished and protected it, yet, when it came,<br />
rejected it, and lost the fruit of their long patience.<br />
"Who are Israelites," he says, mournfully<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_262_10" id="PgLn_262_10">{10}</a></span><br />
lingering over their past glories, "who are Israelites, to<br />
whom belongeth the adoption of children, and<br />

<blockquote><p>What a hard thing it was for him to give them<br />
up! He pleaded for them, while they were<br />
persecuting his Lord and himself. He reminded his<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_262_20" id="PgLn_262_20">{20}</a></span><br />
Lord that he himself had also been that Lord's<br />
persecutor, and why not try them a little longer?<br />
"Lord," he said, "they know that I cast into<br />

Stephen, Thy witness, was shed, I stood by and<br />
consented, and kept the garments of them that<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>realized them as if they were still his own. "I<br />
bear them witness," he says, "that they have a<br />
zeal of God, but not according to knowledge."<br />
O blind! blind! he seems to say; O that there<br />
should be so much of good in them, so much zeal,<br />
so much of religious purpose, so much of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_263_5" id="PgLn_263_5"></a><a href="#Josias">{5}</a></span><br />
steadfastness, such resolve like Josias, Mathathias, or<br />
Machabus, to keep the whole law, and honor<br />
Moses and the Prophets, but all spoiled, all<br />
undone, by one fatal sin! And what is he prompted<br />
to do? Moses, on one occasion, desired to suffer<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_263_10" id="PgLn_263_10">{10}</a></span><br />
instead of his rebellious people: "Either forgive<br />
them this trespass," he said, "or if Thou do not,<br />
strike me out of the book." And now, when the<br />
New Law was in course of promulgation, and the<br />
chosen race was committing the same sin, its<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_263_15" id="PgLn_263_15">{15}</a></span><br />
great Apostle desired the same: "I wished<br />
myself," he says, speaking of the agony he had<br />
passed through, "I wished myself to be an<br />
anathema from Christ, for my brethren, who are<br />
my kinsmen according to the flesh." And then,<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_263_20" id="PgLn_263_20">{20}</a></span><br />
when all was in vain, when they remained<br />
obdurate, and the high decree of God took effect, still<br />
he would not, out of very affection for them, he<br />
would not allow after all that they were<br />
reprobate. He comforted himself with the thought of<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_263_25" id="PgLn_263_25">{25}</a></span><br />
how many were the exceptions to so dismal a<br />
sentence. "Hath God cast away His people?"<br />
he asks; "God forbid. For I also am an Israelite,<br />
of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin."<br />
"All are not Israelites that are of Israel." And<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_263_30" id="PgLn_263_30">{30}</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>he dwells upon his confident anticipation of their<br />
recovery in time to come. "They are enemies,"<br />
he says, writing to the Romans, "for your sakes;"<br />
that is, you have gained by their loss; "but they<br />
are most dear for the sake of the fathers; for the<br />
gifts and the calling of God are without<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_264_5" id="PgLn_264_5">{5}</a></span><br />
repentance." "Blindness in part has happened to<br />
Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles should<br />
come in; and so all Israel should be saved."<br /></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>My Brethren, I have now explained to a<br />
certain extent what I meant when I spoke of St.<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_264_10" id="PgLn_264_10">{10}</a></span><br />
Paul's characteristic gift, as being a special<br />
apprehension of human nature as a fact, and an<br />
intimate familiarity with it as an object of<br />
continual contemplation and affection. He made it<br />
his own to the very full, instead of annihilating<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_264_15" id="PgLn_264_15">{15}</a></span><br />
it; he sympathized with it, while he mortified it<br />
by penance, while he sanctified it by the grace<br />
given him. Though he had never been a heathen,<br />
though he was no longer a Jew, yet he was a<br />
heathen in capability, as I may say, and a Jew<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_264_20" id="PgLn_264_20">{20}</a></span><br />
in the history of the past. His vivid imagination<br />
enabled him to throw himself into the state of<br />
heathenism, with all those tendencies which lay<br />
dormant in his human nature carried out, and<br />
its infirmities developed into sin. His wakeful<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_264_25" id="PgLn_264_25">{25}</a></span><br />
memory enabled him to recall those past<br />
feelings and ideas of a Jew, which in the case of<br />
others a miraculous conversion might have<br />
obliterated; and thus, while he was a Saint inferior<br />
to none, he was emphatically still a man, and to<span class="linenum"><a name="PgLn_264_30" id="PgLn_264_30">{30}</a></span><br />

at that point at which the day leaves him; and<br />

<h3>SAUL</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>


<p><b>Introductory Note.</b> The sketches of Saul and David are contained in the
third volume of <i>Parochial and Plain Sermons</i>. These discourses were
delivered at Oxford before Newman's conversion to the Catholic Church.</p>

<p><b>Saul.</b> <a name="The_first_king_of_Israel" id="The_first_king_of_Israel"></a>The first king of Israel reigned from 1091 to 1051 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> He ruled
conjointly with Samuel the prophet eighteen years, and alone, twenty-two
years. Samuel had been judge of Israel twelve years when the
discontented Jews demanded a king, and Saul was elected by lot.</p>

<p><b>13</b>: 7. <b><a name="Manna" id="Manna"></a>Manna.</b> Miraculous food supplied to the Jews, wandering in the
desert of Sin, after their exodus from Egypt. The taste of manna was
that of flour mixed with honey.</p>

<p><b>13</b>: 10. <b><a name="Moses" id="Moses"></a>Moses.</b> Deliverer, lawgiver, ruler, and prophet of Israel, 1447
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> The author of the <i>Pentateuch</i> is probably the greatest figure of
the Old Law and the most perfect type of Christ. </p>

<p><b>14</b>: 3. <b><a name="Gadara" id="Gadara"></a>Gadara.</b> Noted for the miracle of casting out demons, wrought
there by our Lord. The inhabitants in fear besought Him to leave their
coasts. Mark v. 17. </p>

<p><b>16</b>: 24. <b><a name="David" id="David"></a>David.</b> The prophet and king famous as the royal psalmist. From
his line sprang the Messias. </p>

<p><b>17</b>: 4. <b><a name="The_asses" id="The_asses"></a>The asses.</b> Saul, searching for his father's asses, was met by
Samuel and anointed king. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span><b>17</b>: 14. <b><a name="The_Ammonites" id="The_Ammonites"></a>The Ammonites and Moabites.</b> Warlike heathen tribes
probably descended from Lot. They dwelt near the Dead Sea; were very
hostile to the Jews. </p>

<p><b>17</b>: 15. <b><a name="The_Jordan" id="The_Jordan"></a>The Jordan.</b> Largest river of Palestine, especially consecrated
by the baptism of Christ in its waters; is called the river of judgment.
An air line from the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea is sixty miles, but
so tortuous is the Jordan, its length is two hundred miles. </p>

<p><b>18</b>: 12. <b><a name="Philistines" id="Philistines"></a>Philistines</b> (strangers). Gentiles beyond the Western Sea,
frequently at war with the Hebrews. Samson, Saul, and David were famous
for their victories over these powerful enemies. </p>

<p><b>19</b>: 29. <b><a name="Gods_vicegerent" id="Gods_vicegerent"></a>God's vicegerent.</b> Representative as king. Before Saul the
Jewish government was theocratic, <i>i.e.</i> directly from God. </p>

<p><b>20</b>: 15. <b><a name="Solomon" id="Solomon"></a>Solomon.</b> Son and successor of David, called the wisest of men:
built the temple; became exalted with pride; was punished for his sins:
died probably unrepentant. A striking example of the vanity of human
success unblessed by God. </p>

<p><b>20</b>: 16. <b><a name="Religious_principle" id="Religious_principle"></a>Religious principle.</b> A fundamental truth upon which conduct is
consistently built. A conviction of the intellect and hence
distinguished from instinct, disposition, feeling, often the spring of
men's actions. </p>

<p><b>21</b>: 18. <b><a name="Shekel" id="Shekel"></a>Shekel.</b> A silver coin worth about fifty-seven cents. </p>

<p><b>22</b>: 23. <b><a name="Sacrifice_offered_by_Saul" id="Sacrifice_offered_by_Saul"></a>Sacrifice offered by Saul.</b> Sacrilegious in Saul, as the right
was limited to the priesthood of Aaron. </p>

<p><b>23</b>: 11. <b><a name="Ark_of_God" id="Ark_of_God"></a>Ark of God.</b> A figure of the Christian Tabernacle; divinely
ordained for the Mosaic worship; contained the covenant of God with His
chosen people. </p>

<p><b>24</b>: 13. <b><a name="Religion_a_utility" id="Religion_a_utility"></a>Religion a utility.</b> Inversion of Christ's command,&mdash;"Seek
ye therefore first the kingdom of God and His justice and all these
things shall be added unto <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>you." Matthew vi. 33. </p>

<p><b>25</b>: 8. <b><a name="Joshua" id="Joshua"></a>Joshua.</b> Successor of Moses and leader of the Jews into the
Promised Land. </p>

<p><b>27</b>: 8. <b><a name="The_uncircumcised" id="The_uncircumcised"></a>The uncircumcised.</b> Term applied to all outside the Hebrew
people. Circumcision, a figure of baptism, was the sign of covenant
given by God to Abraham and his descendants.</p>


<h3>EARLY YEARS OF DAVID</h3>

<p><b>28</b>: 6. <b><a name="The_Psalms" id="The_Psalms"></a>The Psalms.</b> One hundred and fifty inspired hymns of praise, joy,
thanksgiving, and repentance, composed chiefly by David. Humanly
speaking, they form the most exquisite lyric poetry extant, and in their
strong, majestic beauty are most suitable to the Divine Offices of the
Church.</p>

<p><b>29</b>: 3. <b><a name="Balaam" id="Balaam"></a>Balaam.</b> An Oriental prophet of Mesopotamia, 1500 B<span class="smcap">.C.</span> Sent for
by the Moabite king to curse the Israelites. </p>

<p><b>29</b>: 11. (<i>a</i>) <b><a name="Judah" id="Judah"></a>Judah.</b> (<i>b</i>) <b>Shiloh.</b> (<i>a</i>) The fourth son of Jacob and
Leah. (<i>b</i>) The Messias. </p>

<p><b>30</b>: 14. <b><a name="Anointing_of_David" id="Anointing_of_David"></a>Anointing of David.</b> To signify that the kingship, like the
priesthood, is a sacred office, <i>all</i> power coming from God. </p>

<p><b>31</b>: 6. <b><a name="Sacred_songs" id="Sacred_songs"></a>Sacred songs.</b> The inspired music of David was the means of
restoring grace to the troubled spirit of Saul. Browning's <i>Saul</i> paints
strikingly the character of the shepherd boy and of the distracted old
king. </p>

<p><b>32</b>: 1. <b><a name="Goliath_of_Gath" id="Goliath_of_Gath"></a>Goliath of Gath.</b> A type of the giant, Sin; also of Lucifer,
overcome by the meek Christ, who is prefigured by David. </p>

<p><b>34</b>: 6. <b>T<a name="he_Apostle" id="he_Apostle"></a>he Apostle.</b> St. Paul, who recounts to the Hebrews his
sufferings for Christ. </p>

<p><b>36</b>: 5. <b><a name="Joseph" id="Joseph"></a>Joseph.</b> Son of Jacob; governor of Egypt <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>under Pharaoh.</p>

<p><b>36</b>: 16. <b><a name="From_Moses" id="From_Moses"></a>From Moses.</b> A fine distinction between the theocratic and the
royal government of Israel. </p>

<p><b>38</b>: 24. <b><a name="The_kings_son-in-law" id="The_kings_son-in-law"></a>The king's son-in-law.</b> Saul in envy married his daughter Michol
to David "that she might prove a stumbling-block to him." </p>

<p><b>39</b>: 4. <b><a name="David_and_Joseph" id="David_and_Joseph"></a>David and Joseph.</b> Note the consistent and forcible parallel. </p>

<p><b>43</b> and <b>44</b>: <b><a name="The_patriarchs" id="The_patriarchs"></a>The patriarchs.</b> This passage illustrates the exquisite choice
of words, the perfect finish of sentence, and the wonderful beauty of
thought characteristic of Newman. </p>


<h3>BASIL AND GREGORY</h3>

<p><b>Introductory Note.</b> <a name="These_Essays" id="These_Essays"></a>These Essays on the Fathers are to be found in
<i>Historical Sketches</i>, Vol. III. They were written to illustrate the
tone and mode of thought, the habits and manners of the early times of
the Church. </p>

<p><b><a name="Athens" id="Athens"></a>Athens.</b> Most of those who sought Attic wisdom were natures without
control. "Basil and Gregory were spoiled for subtle, beautiful,
luxurious Athens. They walked their straight and loving road to God,
with the simplicity which alone could issue out of the intense purpose
of their lives&mdash;the love and service of Christ their Lord." </p>

<p><b>45</b>: 15. <b><a name="Hildebrand" id="Hildebrand"></a>Hildebrand.</b> St. Gregory VII, one of the greatest among the
great Roman pontiffs. He combated the evils of the eleventh century,
within and without the Church, and effected incalculable good,
especially in the war of Investitures waged against Henry IV of Germany.</p>

<p><b>45</b>: 17. <b><a name="City_of_God" id="City_of_God"></a>City of God.</b> The Church.</p>

<p><b>45</b>: 18. <b><a name="Ambrose" id="Ambrose"></a>Ambrose.</b> Archbishop of Milan, noted for zeal in spreading the
faith; remembered for his fearless</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>rebuke of the Emperor Theodosius. <b>46</b>: 30. <b>Pontus.</b> Part of
<a name="Cappadocia" id="Cappadocia"></a>Cappadocia in Asia Minor; founded by Alexander the Great. </p>

<p><b>47</b>: 28. <b><a name="The_contention" id="The_contention"></a>The contention.</b> See Acts of the Apostles xv. 39.</p>

<p><b>49</b>: 16. <b><a name="Armenian_creed" id="Armenian_creed"></a>Armenian creed.</b> Similar to that of the Greek Church.</p>

<p><b>55</b>: 17. <b><a name="The_Thesbite" id="The_Thesbite"></a>The Thesbite.</b> Elias, who dwelt on Carmel, as did St. John the
Baptist, in most rigorous penance.</p>

<p><b>55</b>: 18. <b><a name="Carmel" id="Carmel"></a>Carmel.</b> A mountain on the coast of Palestine, noted in sacred
history.</p>


<h3>AUGUSTINE AND THE VANDALS</h3>

<p><b>56</b>: 7. <b><a name="Heretical_creed" id="Heretical_creed"></a>Heretical creed.</b> The Arians were followers of Arius of
Alexandria, who boldly denied the Divinity of Jesus Christ. The heresy
was condemned by the Council of Nice, 325 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, but its baneful effects
were widely felt for centuries.</p>

<p><b>56</b>: 15. <b><a name="Apocalypse" id="Apocalypse"></a>Apocalypse.</b> Wonderful revelations made to St. John at Patmos
concerning the Church, the final judgment, the future life.</p>

<p><b>57</b>: 21. <b><a name="The_Vandals" id="The_Vandals"></a>The Vandals.</b> A barbarian race of Southern Germany, who in the
fifth century ravaged Gaul, Spain, Italy, and Northern Africa.</p>

<p><b>59</b>: 13. <b><a name="Montanists" id="Montanists"></a>Montanists.</b> A sect of the second century that believed in
Montanus as a prophet, and in the near advent of Christ to judge the
world. </p>

<p><b>60</b>: 31. (<i>a</i>) <b><a name="The_prophet" id="The_prophet"></a>The prophet.</b> (<i>b</i>) <b>Jeroboam.</b> (<i>a</i>) Ahias. (<i>b</i>) The first
king of Israel after the separation of the tribes; a man perverse and
irreverent in his relations with God and subject. </p>

<p><b>59</b> to <b>70</b>. <b><a name="The_argument" id="The_argument"></a>The argument.</b> The apology for flight in times of religious
persecution, made by Athanasius, the great bishop of Alexandria, fourth
century, and the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>cogent argument against it of Tertullian, a
celebrated writer of the second century, show how circumstances, above
all, Divine inspiration, justify opposite lines of action. St.
Augustine's letter, written in his strong and luminous style, reconciles
the two points of view. </p>

<p><b>71</b> to <b>74</b>. <b><a name="The_misery_of_irreligion" id="The_misery_of_irreligion"></a>The misery of irreligion.</b> A profound analysis of the two
classes of men without religion,&mdash;the one distorted, brutalized,
and deadened; the other confused, wild, and hungering after what is to
them indefinable, yet alone satisfying. Compare in its source, tenor,
and effect the unhappiness of the "popular poet" Byron and that of
Augustine. </p>

<p><b>76</b>: 8. <b><a name="St_Monica" id="St_Monica"></a>St. Monica.</b> One of the greatest women of all times; a model of
faith, constancy, and maternal love. </p>

<p><b>79</b>: 23. <b><a name="Christianity_a_philosophy" id="Christianity_a_philosophy"></a>Christianity a philosophy.</b> Such it is accounted by many modern
thinkers who, in spite of clear, full evidences of its divinity, affect
to doubt or deny altogether the supernatural. These reduce the Gospels
to a code of ethics, and regard Christ as merely a teacher of morality;
the earnestness of Augustine would lead them by a short road to
recognize and worship God in Jesus Christ. </p>


<h3>CHRYSOSTOM</h3>

<p><b>84</b> to <b>90</b>. <b>The Introduction.</b> <a name="The_personal_touch" id="The_personal_touch"></a>The personal touch of these pages gives an
insight into the tender, sensitive nature of Cardinal Newman. He was a
man not only of intense and powerful intellect, but of delicate and
affectionate heart. It is his gracious, winning appeal that renders him
irresistible in influence. </p>

<p><b>90</b>: 12. <b>Chrysostom.</b> "<a name="Golden_mouth" id="Golden_mouth"></a>Golden mouth," from his eloquence. He is counted
among the great Patristic writers. </p>

<b>90</b>: 22. <b><a name="Fulvia" id="Fulvia"></a>Fulvia.</b> Wife of Marc Antony; noted for her cruelty and ambition. </p>

<p><b>92</b>: 6. (<i>a</i>) <b><a name="Gallus" id="Gallus"></a>Gallus.</b> (<i>b</i>) <b>Ovid.</b> (<i>a</i>) Governor of Egypt under
Augustus; accused of crime and oppression, and banished. (<i>b</i>) A
celebrated Roman poet, author of <i>Metamorphoses</i>; exiled by Augustus for
some grave offense never revealed. </p>

<p><b>97</b>: 12. <b><a name="The_seasons" id="The_seasons"></a>The seasons.</b> This apt and ingenious analogy is regarded as one
of Newman's more beautiful passages. </p>

<p><b>100</b>: 30. <b><a name="Chrysostoms_discriminating_affectionateness" id="Chrysostoms_discriminating_affectionateness"></a>Chrysostom's discriminating affectionateness.</b> The reason,
probably, why he has so great a hold upon the heart of
posterity&mdash;love begets love. </p>

<p><b>105</b>: 8. <b><a name="Cucusus" id="Cucusus"></a>Cucusus.</b> In Caucasus, east of the Black Sea and north of
Persia. </p>

<p><b>108</b>: 19. <b><a name="Troas" id="Troas"></a>Troas.</b> In Northwest Asia Minor. Troad contains ancient Troy. </p>

<p><b>105</b> to <b>110</b>. <b><a name="The_letters_of_Chrysostom" id="The_letters_of_Chrysostom"></a>The letters of Chrysostom.</b> The charm of his genius, the
sweetness of his temper under suffering, and the unselfishness of his
lofty soul appear in these simple lines written on the road or in the
desert of his banishment. </p>


<h3>THE TARTAR AND THE TURK</h3>

<h3>WHAT IS A UNIVERSITY?</h3>

<p><b>Introductory Note.</b> <a name="Newmans_purpose" id="Newmans_purpose"></a>Newman's purpose in these Essays is to set forth by
description and statement the nature, the work, and the peculiarities of
a University; the aims with which it is established, the wants it may
supply, the methods it adopts, its relation to other <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg
278]</a></span>institutions, and its general history. The illustrations of his idea
of a University first appeared in the <i>Dublin University Gazette</i>;
later, in one volume, <i>Office and Work of Universities</i>. In the present
form the author has exchanged the title to <i>Historical Sketches</i>, but
has retained the pleasantly conversational tone of the original, lest,
as he says, he might become more exact and solid at the price of
becoming less readable, in the judgment of a day which considers that "a
great book is a great evil." </p>

<p><b>159</b>: 14. <b><a name="A_gentleman" id="A_gentleman"></a>A gentleman.</b> Dr. Newman is unconsciously painting his own
portrait in this passage. </p>

<p><b>161</b>: 17. <b><a name="St_Irenaeus" id="St_Irenaeus"></a>St. Irenus.</b> A Christian martyr of the second century. He was

which denied the Personality of Jesus Christ. </p>

<p><b>188</b>: 28. <b><a name="Scholastic_philosophy" id="Scholastic_philosophy"></a>Scholastic philosophy.</b> A constructive system founded by
Aristotle, Christianized by Boethius, amplified by St. Anselm, Albert
the Great, and others, perfected as a school, in its being harmonized
with theology, by St. Thomas of Aquin. Love of subtilizing and of
display, and barbarity of terminology, caused its decline after the
thirteenth century. Political and religious strife also accelerated
decadence, until the Council of Trent restored philosophy to its true
position as queen of human sciences and handmaid of Religion. The chief
feature of Christian scholastic philosophy is the harmonizing of natural
and supernatural truth, <i>i.e.</i> the unifying of philosophy and theology,
or the perfect conciliation of reason with faith&mdash;<i>distinction</i>
without <i>opposition</i>. </p>

sweet, impassioned eloquence. His sentences roll on like music of
indefinable tenderness and beauty. What wonder if men "who came to scoff
remained to pray," when the tones of that voice Matthew Arnold could not
describe&mdash;for its singular sweetness&mdash;fell upon their
listening souls? </p>

Neither music, nor painting, nor poetry, can have anything more
exquisite to yield, it would seem. </p>

<p><b>The Second Spring.</b> This sermon is very characteristic of Newman in its
appeal to the <i>whole man</i> listening; he not only rivets the
intelligence, but stirs the will and moves the heart by the intensity,

1857, forms one of the <i>Sermons on Various Occasions</i>. Paul&mdash;that
godlike man who longed to be anathema from Christ if thereby he could
serve the brethren&mdash;was Newman's saint by predilection; and
allusions to his character and mission are frequent in the Cardinal's
writings. </p>

him in the struggle, (<i>c</i>) "The Hammer." Judas gained glorious victories
over the Idumeans, Ammonites, and other heathen tribes, and the Bible

<p>In the original book the line numbers ran from 1 to 30 on each page. In
the Notes, the first figure represents the page number and the second
number represents the line number. For example, in the third note:</p>

    <blockquote><p><b>13</b>: 7. <b>Manna.</b> Miraculous food supplied to the Jews,
    wandering in the desert of Sin, after their exodus from Egypt.
    The taste of manna was that of flour mixed with honey.<br /></p></blockquote>

<p>the 13 refers to the page number and the 7 refers to the line number on
that page.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
